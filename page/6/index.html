            Spring date to the foot of SuraksanNowon-gu, Seoul, KoreaAs spring approaches, we have a date course where you can take a gentle walk and a cup of hot coffee. When we say 'mountain', we often think of 'Hasanju', but if it's the same time as the spring breeze is blowing, wouldn't it be better to add 'tea' instead of 'sake'? I left the early spring outing with a walk and a cup of tea at Suaksan Mountain located in Uijeongbu and Nowon-gu, Gyeonggi-do.
