            Chungju Chungju is the hometown of Jungwon culture. Prehistoric remains remain around the Namhan River, and in the Three Kingdoms era, it was a fierce battlefield to occupy Jungwon. It is also the place where Jungwongyeong was made among the 5 blind spots since the Three Kingdoms period. In January, a large amount of bronze artifacts from the early Iron Age were excavated in Hoam-dong, Chungju. In the early Iron Age tomb 19 artifacts were excavated all at once, including the Sejong bronze sword. Let's meet Chungju's history from prehistoric times to Goryeo dynasty along the Namhan River, which is dotted with intense historical traces and various ruins. Chungju, Chungbuk, South Korea.

            Four seasons to see and eat Tongyeong. Perhaps the first thing that makes this Tongyeong trip even more special is his gem-like islands. The islands, which are scattered all the way to the far seas, including Hansan Island, Yongho Island, Bijin Island, Jangsa Island, Yeonhwa Island, Yeokdo Island, and Retail Road, embrace Tongyeong in the name of the tea ceremony. Hansando, which is only 30 minutes from Tongyeong, has the advantage of distance and the trail of Admiral Yi Sun-sin. Today, I decided to look back to Chubong Island, which connects Hansan and Yondo Bridge, for a more special trip to Hansan. 'Hansando' would be a different journey for those who only thought of 'General Yi Sun-sin' and 'Jeseungdang'. Tongyeong, Gyeongnam, Korea. Korea Tour

            The journey begins with daily life. It is because you feel inspiration from the moment you see something familiar, and it is identified with the excitement you experience in an unfamiliar destination. For example, Yongsan Printing Industrial Complex, which goes by way of work, and the national office that stops on the way home. It's so common that you just listen to the extraordinary things that are hidden in them. Maybe this is the best place to forget the cold wind this winter. Korea, Seoul. Korea Tour

            I have a carpenter friend. When asked about the merits of work, the answer is, "I can touch the tree." I also like to touch trees. The texture of the wood is 'emotional' compared to other objects. Not smooth but calm While living in wood, even after dying in furniture and books. So when you touch a tree, 'good' and 'reliable' are pushed to one side of your heart.
