            Geojedo National Highway 14 is famous for its beautiful scenery. After passing Buksan Mountain and heading south to the sea, an impressive village appears. It is a gujo-la village that crosses the sea next to a land that looks as long as a giraffe's neck and thin like an ant's waist. There is a small mountain beyond the narrow and long town, so the impression that you want to look around is imminent. Entered the Gujo La Village as attracted by the strange charm. It's past winter, but the weather seems a bit winter, and it's too cold for spring, so it's the south side of the peninsula that shines. Jeju Island is fine, but Geoje Island is a good alternative when transportation is burdensome. It leads to Geoje Bridge, so it is easy to access and has a warm atmosphere. Beyond Geoje Bridge, you can enjoy the scenery of Namhae next to it. There are peaceful seas, islands with grains of grain, roofs gathered on the shores of fishing villages, and ships anchored in the harbor. Among them, the unique features of Geoje Island are the complex Rias coastline and the surrounding landscape. It has become monotonous with people's hands, but the coastline, which is infrequent in nature, can be seen with its intricate coastline. Take the Geoje-daero along the coastline to the east of Geoje-do, and move south to Gujo-la Village. Geoje-si, Gyeongnam, Korea. Korea Tour
