            It is a good time to walk. Wherever you want to walk, the place I chose today is the Sea of Japan Sea Route. Among them, we walk on the sunrise road of Donghae City, where the magnificent seascape and charming sights are combined. The coastal road (ilchulro) hidden inside National Highway 7 passes through Mukho Port, Eodal Port, and Daejin Port. Mukho Lighthouse, Nongoldamgil, Kamakbawi, and many other attractions, simple and small houses and shops are in harmony. When you pass by car, you can see the scenes that you may have missed.
