            As spring approaches, we have a date course where you can take a gentle walk and a cup of hot coffee. When we say 'mountain', we often think of 'Hasanju', but if it's the same time as the spring breeze is blowing, wouldn't it be better to add 'tea' instead of 'sake'? I left the early spring outing with a walk and a cup of tea at Suaksan Mountain located in Uijeongbu and Nowon-gu, Gyeonggi-do.

Located between Sanggye-dong, Nowon-gu, Seoul, and Uijeongbu-si, Gyeonggi-do, Suraksan (638m) is a mountain that is beloved by citizens along with Bukhansan, Dobongsan, and Bulamsan. The seemingly muscular rock walls may make hiking a burden, but pickling is not so harsh. Professional mountaineers can enjoy hiking in the mountains of Bulam ~ Suraksan ~ Dobongsan ~ Bukhansan, but it is enough to enjoy one by one. Nowon-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour
