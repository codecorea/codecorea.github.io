            The bustling streets of the carols, the trees that reveal their individuality, the sparkling lights, the people who are busy walking. All those scenery we call Christmas. By the way, for 10 years, there is a village to celebrate Christmas with a little different from that of the city center. At this time of year, the main character is Naju Isl Village, which simply renovates country roads and promotes harmony between residents and other tourists. After successfully hosting Happy Christmas in the Isle Village in the winter of 2007, let's go to the Isle Village, which has become the first Christmas village in Korea. Naju, Jeonnam, Korea.

            As a child, I imagined flying freely in a big balloon like a heroine in a fairy tale. The desire to fly in the sky as an adult remains the same. It's exciting to imagine that you're flying in the wind with a hot air balloon instead of an airplane. The place to make that dream come true is Seokyung-ri village in Icheon, Gyeonggi-do. From this place, it floats up to the sky and flies around the Icheon plain, where the autumn light has fallen. Icheon, South Korea. Korea Tour
