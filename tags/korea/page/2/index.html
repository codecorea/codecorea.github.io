            There are shops that are returning with hundreds or thousands of SNS certification shots. The price seems a bit high, but the attractive idea that satisfies everything including taste, space, atmosphere and mood deserves to slip away from your pocket.

After seeing the exterior, opening the door, sitting and watching the fun, he turns his head, and as soon as the food comes into the mouth, the admiration gun is fired.

            The warm spring breeze blows softly and the hips are hilarious. The energy of spring multiplies the excitement of travel. It's a good season to go anywhere. The sea full of spring breeze is good and the market full of spring energy is good. If you add seasonal delicacies that will enhance your taste buds in spring, you can add icing. It would be better if the food is not common anywhere. So I chose Seosan, Chungnam, where the sea, the market, and seasonal delicacies are located. Seosan, Chungnam, South Korea. Korea Tour
