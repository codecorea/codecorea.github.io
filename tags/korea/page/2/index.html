            Seolmaejae is the filming location for the movie <Kwannwan>, the best topic in the second half of 2013. It was a time when the family of Naekyung (Song Kang-ho) lived comfortably. Looking down from the silver grass hill in front of the house, the anxiety disappears. In the autumn outing, a nearby Yongmunsa Temple with 1,100-year-old ginkgo trees is also recommended.

It is a scenery that can only be met by climbing the V-train and Baekdu-daegan gorge train. The pine trees growing in the rocks and the beautifully colored larch are as close to touching as you can.

            From July 25th to August 2nd, 'Yeoncheon DMZ International Music Festival' will be held in Yeoncheon-gun, Gyeonggi-do for 9 days. The main stage of the festival is the Jeokgok-ri Seonje Historic Site, Hantan River Tourist Site, and Sureul Art Hall. This year, with the theme of “coexistence,” about 40 musicians, including Sook-ryun Park, will produce chords. Orchestra performances, concerts by artists from around the world, fringe concerts, visiting concerts, music academies, and classical lectures are held throughout the music festival. I believe that the feast of beautiful classics created by travelers from Yeoncheon-gun and artists from around the world will greatly contribute to the settlement of peace on the Korean Peninsula.

            Children play well with sand or even a few branches. When a child sits on the ground or crawls after an ant, the parents become furious. I hate to get my clothes dirty, and I wonder if the germs may move. So, these days, kids spend time inside their homes, or at best, play in kids cafes and indoor playgrounds. It is the wish of every parent that a child grows up healthy. If you want your body and mind to be healthy and grow up in nature, you need to let them play in nature, not artificial amusement facilities. Children make play by using all kinds of creative methods even with simple natural objects. Stepping on the soil, smelling wild flowers, and playing in the woods, where you can feel the warmth of the trees, is close by. Geumcheon-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour
