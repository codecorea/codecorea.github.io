            Sneakers made by collecting PET bottles discarded in the sea, tarpaulins for old trucks, airbags for scrapped cars, bags made of seat belts, and watches made from scrapped bicycle chains are sold at a higher price than ordinary products. Some are not available because they are limited edition. Literally, the junk is transformed into a masterpiece. In the world, 'UpCycling' is the trend. In Europe, upcycling crazes have been blowing in Korea since several years ago. Upcycling is derived from recycling, which means recycling, and refers to adding new values such as design beyond simply reusing discarded objects. Where is the fashion field? Upcycling spaces are emerging in Korea these days. Many places called hot places across the country are attracting attention by upcycling abandoned spaces.
