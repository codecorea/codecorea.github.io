            Dessert, is there something sweeter and more tempting than this? A bitter black coffee and a dessert that was born in a natural way began to make a refreshing transformation with a beer and a meal instead of a meal. The five desserts I found on Itaewon's alleys are as delicious and lovely as the exotic. The power of a piece of dessert that blows away everyday stress in one room! Whispers secretly and sweetly despite the high calories and burdensome prices. It's okay, it's a dessert. Yongsan-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour

            Is it attracted to analog sensibility in the cutting edge era? You can read an e-book with a smartphone, tablet PC, or dedicated terminal, but it cannot replace the warm feeling of a paper book. Reading a book is more than just reading text, it is an act of combining various elements into one, such as feeling the texture of a paper, turning a bookcase, measuring the thickness of a book, and smelling paper. Turning off your smartphone for a while and opening a book is sometimes a pleasant break. It is in the same context that the two new libraries are welcome. In addition, both libraries have great designs and interiors, and it is even more pleasing to say that collections are rare books that are not easily accessible. Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea.

            I saw a piece of wood erected on a plate of water at a vinyl house flower shop. There is no root, but one green leaf growing on a piece of wood leaves a long aftertaste. Sometimes when your head is heavy and your heart feels dry, imagine putting your mind on a plate of water. Then I draw a picture of a leaf coming out of my mind, but it still works quite well. This time, I tried to raise my mind and body in the 'Korean Folk Village', a village where folklore is high. Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. Korea Tour

            Isn't red apple the best jewel in autumn? The red color is more beautiful and charming than Ruby. If you bite a big bite, the juice that soaks your mouth sweetly and the crunchy sound is also excellent. I visited Mungyeong to harvest apples more expensive than jewelry. This is also the time for the Mungyeong Apple Festival. From October 13th to 28th, you can experience Mungyeong apple in various ways at Mungyeong Saejae Provincial Park. Also, if you are looking for an apple festival experience farmer, you can also experience apple picking. Many farmhouses experience it regardless of the festival. Mungyeong, Gyeongbuk, South Korea.

The Geum River, which flows gently, crosses the body of Seocheon, and seagulls fly freely in the small muzzle. Maryangpo wakes up the morning with a throbbing sound. The Seocheon Botanical Arts Center is equipped with simple yet elegant bonsais, and you can experience the maze park and various agricultural cultures. Seosan's Hansan Ramie is one of the major essences of our national culture, which is important enough to be registered as a National Intangible Cultural Heritage No. 14 and listed as a UNESCO human intangible cultural heritage (28 November 2011). By this time, you can see the fantastic military service of migratory birds traveling to distant foreign countries.
