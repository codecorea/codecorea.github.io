            When it was snowy winter, I visited the morning calm arboretum, a winter kingdom that glistens with a brilliant autumnal glow. Many people visit the arboretum even in this season thanks to the “Five Starlight Garden” held every winter. When the darkness fell, I followed the colored lights blooming. It is also suitable for a quiet downtown dating course. A winter festival of lights held at this time of year. The five-pointed starlight garden, which celebrated its eighth anniversary this year, will continue until March 15, when the vegetation is asleep. Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. Korea Tour

            From July 25th to August 2nd, 'Yeoncheon DMZ International Music Festival' will be held in Yeoncheon-gun, Gyeonggi-do for 9 days. The main stage of the festival is the Jeokgok-ri Seonje Historic Site, Hantan River Tourist Site, and Sureul Art Hall. This year, with the theme of “coexistence,” about 40 musicians, including Sook-ryun Park, will produce chords. Orchestra performances, concerts by artists from around the world, fringe concerts, visiting concerts, music academies, and classical lectures are held throughout the music festival. I believe that the feast of beautiful classics created by travelers from Yeoncheon-gun and artists from around the world will greatly contribute to the settlement of peace on the Korean Peninsula.
