            I go early in the morning. Soongneung opened this year. Sungneung is the 18th Joseon Dynasty and the tomb of Queen Myeongseong. It has been closed for many years among the nine tombs of the copper hills, and was opened to the public earlier this year. The Sungneung revealed the first fresh green. The road to “Secret Nest” is a cozy forest path that has not been reached by foreigners for a while. The morning forest is deep, and the birdsong is perfect. In short, Sungneung in the early morning is a serene tomb without the crowds of the three. Guri-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. Korea Tour

            The phrase 'Cheongpungho Jadrakgil' is very pretty. It's also soft to pronounce, and it feels like ‘Sabujakjidada’, meaning that it acts lightly and effortlessly. I feel that it will be a trekking course that is easy to walk for some reason. Jadrak-gil refers to ‘a narrow path in a hilly country at the foot of a mountain.’ The name Cheongpungho is in front of it because the road runs around the mountain village surrounding Cheongpungho. It is a hiking trail, but it is difficult to walk. Of the 100 ridges in Cheongpungho in Jecheon, it is difficult to find a walking trail with such a great view point, as you walk along the beautiful scenery around the lake.

            There is a saying that all roads in the northern Boryeong area connect with Ocheon. This is because the port of Ocheon served as the main port and military port of Boryeong in the Baekje period. Since then, Ocheon Port has become a small fishing port, but recently it has been regaining its old glory due to the clamshell. Ocheon Port occupies about 60% of the country's production, and gourmets from all over the country gather at the port. Azalea blooming is the key season in April. Boryeong, Chungnam, Korea.

Among them, Isabu Lion Park, which has works of art and history, a marine rail bike that cools the winter sea and the sea breeze, and the legend of the Samcheok fishermen and the Haesindang Park with a unique atmosphere. It is called 'Samcheok Sea Close'. Samcheok has an important meaning of advancing into the East Sea and defending marine territories in Korean marine pioneers. After the Imjin War, a more specialized military position 'warrant' was placed in Samcheokpojin, and Samcheokpojin was also an important starting point for overseeing Gangwon-do and Gyeongbuk coastal defenses until the 35th year of King Gojong (1898).
