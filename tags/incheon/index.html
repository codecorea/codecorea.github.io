            Large and small peaks stood on the sea. Haemu came in and wrapped around comfortably. Gaetti-gil along the ridge has a fresh summer scent. Every time a blade of grass grazes the ankle, the cicadas are rumbling. I stopped walking for a moment and wiped the sweat from my forehead. I sat on a rock and watched the plane take off from Yeongjongdo Island and drank ice water. So I learned how to fly in Jangbongdo in the summer. Ongjin-gun, Incheon, Korea. Korea Tour

            Next to the bustling Chinatown, Incheon Open Port Modern History and Culture Town has a history of more than 130 years after opening. Compared to Chinatown, spaces that resemble black and white photographs seem to be hidden in the more leisurely streets. I found a space that has been reborn as a sensuous cafe or gallery by recycling buildings that have been lit up with traces of time. Let's walk through the faded time. Jung-gu, Incheon, Korea.

            I have a carpenter friend. When asked about the merits of work, the answer is, "I can touch the tree." I also like to touch trees. The texture of the wood is 'emotional' compared to other objects. Not smooth but calm While living in wood, even after dying in furniture and books. So when you touch a tree, 'good' and 'reliable' are pushed to one side of your heart.
