            Isn't red apple the best jewel in autumn? The red color is more beautiful and charming than Ruby. If you bite a big bite, the juice that soaks your mouth sweetly and the crunchy sound is also excellent. I visited Mungyeong to harvest apples more expensive than jewelry. This is also the time for the Mungyeong Apple Festival. From October 13th to 28th, you can experience Mungyeong apple in various ways at Mungyeong Saejae Provincial Park. Also, if you are looking for an apple festival experience farmer, you can also experience apple picking. Many farmhouses experience it regardless of the festival. Mungyeong, Gyeongbuk, South Korea.

        <div class="content">
            In the Joseon Dynasty, the rich man (in Yeongnam Province) was called 'Manseokman'. I'm a full-timer. Grain Bay is a horse that is rich with rice fields that are about to be harvested. Stones and islands can be viewed in the same unit. Even if it is not necessarily full, it means that it is rich. As a modern person living in the age of cash, I wonder. How rich is it now? For easy calculation, let's hit an island of rice with a bale. One bale weighs 80 kg. Currently, if the price of rice is about 20,000 won at about 20 kg, one bale is 200,000 won. It is 200,000 won on an island, so if it is an island, it is 2 billion won. If one island of rice (180 liters) is hit with two bales, the value is even higher. In other words, when converting Manseok-man in modern times, it means the rich with the lowest annual income of over 2 billion won. Manseokman is so rich in radishes, and the mind that looked a little shallow disappears like snow in the spring sun. Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, Korea. Korea Tour

However, it is not easy to find all the royal tombs in Gyeongju, which is hard to find even for a week. So it is often not found even though it is a special place.
