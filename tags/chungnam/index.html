            The warm spring breeze blows softly and the hips are hilarious. The energy of spring multiplies the excitement of travel. It's a good season to go anywhere. The sea full of spring breeze is good and the market full of spring energy is good. If you add seasonal delicacies that will enhance your taste buds in spring, you can add icing. It would be better if the food is not common anywhere. So I chose Seosan, Chungnam, where the sea, the market, and seasonal delicacies are located. Seosan, Chungnam, South Korea. Korea Tour

The first Korean architecture of Itami Jun, which built the Jeju Grape Hotel and the Ark Church, will be reviewed and the reason why Lee Jong-ho's architect covered Chungmugong Yi Sun-shin Memorial Hall with soil. We will also listen to the eco-friendly story of Asan, the observation deck on the chimney of 150m high incinerator, the first comedy theater remodeling the abandoned warehouse.

            To catch the end of the fall, he buryed the dead warriors to bury the last season. Yun Dae-nyeong, who wrote the novel, called Muryangsa as “the jangji (season) where the seasons sink.” When the leaves run out, it will be reminiscent of the sadness of a year. However, the bitterness of autumn, which is more abundant than gold, is swallowed up at once. Can we ask about the season that passed from Buyeo Muryangsa where Kim Si-ryong, the wind luck and genius poet of Joseon, spent his last years? . Buyeo County, Chungnam, South Korea. Korea Tour
