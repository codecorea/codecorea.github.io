            Boryeong city in Chungnam has tourist attractions such as Oseo Mountain and Boryeong Lake in the inland, Daecheon Beach and Muchangpo Beach on the coast. The Daecheon Beach is the site of the Boryeong Mud Festival, and the Muchangpo Beach is famous for opening the sea of mystery. That's why summer vacationers visit a lot. If you are planning a summer resort on the beach of Boryeong, look back at Yongdu, Doksan, and Jangan. Accommodations, restaurants, public transportation, toilets, and showers are more inconvenient than Daecheon or Muchangpo, but are said to be a suitable summer resort for those who want a relatively less crowded beach.

            There is a saying that all roads in the northern Boryeong area connect with Ocheon. This is because the port of Ocheon served as the main port and military port of Boryeong in the Baekje period. Since then, Ocheon Port has become a small fishing port, but recently it has been regaining its old glory due to the clamshell. Ocheon Port occupies about 60% of the country's production, and gourmets from all over the country gather at the port. Azalea blooming is the key season in April. Boryeong, Chungnam, Korea.

It is a traditional brewery that first started making alcohol in 1933, and passed from grandfather to father and from father to son for the third time. Where did that long time go? The ‘sake taste’ does not fall out, as it was selected as a dinner party in the Blue House in 2009 due to its deeply aged taste.
