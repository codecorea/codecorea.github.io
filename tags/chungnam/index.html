            Autumn has come silently, but the ripe autumn leaves still have to wait. As I wait for the autumn leaves, I go to a place where I'm impatient or the autumn breeze is overwhelming. It is a silver grass colony of Oseo Mountain in Boryeong, Chungnam. The sunset over the silver grass, the golden field and the glow of the west coast are bonuses.

            <Sinpyeongyang Brewery> is located in a quiet village in Dangjin, Chungnam. It is a traditional brewery that first started making alcohol in 1933, and passed from grandfather to father and from father to son for the third time. Where did that long time go? The ‘sake taste’ does not fall out, as it was selected as a dinner party in the Blue House in 2009 due to its deeply aged taste.

            The warm spring breeze blows softly and the hips are hilarious. The energy of spring multiplies the excitement of travel. It's a good season to go anywhere. The sea full of spring breeze is good and the market full of spring energy is good. If you add seasonal delicacies that will enhance your taste buds in spring, you can add icing. It would be better if the food is not common anywhere. So I chose Seosan, Chungnam, where the sea, the market, and seasonal delicacies are located. Seosan, Chungnam, South Korea. Korea Tour

However, the bitterness of autumn, which is more abundant than gold, is swallowed up at once.
