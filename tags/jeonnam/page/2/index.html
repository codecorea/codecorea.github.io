            The bustling streets of the carols, the trees that reveal their individuality, the sparkling lights, the people who are busy walking. All those scenery we call Christmas. By the way, for 10 years, there is a village to celebrate Christmas with a little different from that of the city center. At this time of year, the main character is Naju Isl Village, which simply renovates country roads and promotes harmony between residents and other tourists. After successfully hosting Happy Christmas in the Isle Village in the winter of 2007, let's go to the Isle Village, which has become the first Christmas village in Korea. Naju, Jeonnam, Korea.

This is a sentence explaining Octopus in Asset Asset. An octopus that makes a fallen cow jump up. The nickname of “sea ginseng” has a high content of taurine and histidine, which is excellent in tonics. It is the reason why it became famous as stamina food for tired people.

            Wando-gun. Is it because the island contains ‘島’. Wando is more popular with his islands than the main island itself. It's easy to think of Slow City's Cheongsan-do and Bogil-do, which bears alpine Yun Sun-do. To enter these two islands, you have to board a boat from Wando or the neighboring town of Haenam. As a result, even though they traveled to Wando, it is not uncommon for them to travel to the main island of Wando. That doesn't mean there's nothing to see on Wando Island. So today I prepared a round trip to Wando main island. Wando-gun, Jeonnam, Korea. Korea Tour
