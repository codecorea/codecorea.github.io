    The fall of Baekje, about 1350 years passed. The name of Buyeo remains unchanged, and the Geum River still flows. However, the appearance of Baekje shining on it is only faint. In search of Baekje&#39;s tapir, I headed for the National Buying Museum.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   The Baekje Culture Zone in Chungnam was caught up late due to the development of the Silla Culture Zone. Just 50 years ago, artifacts and information related to Baekje were significantly lower in quantity and level than they are now. It would not be an exaggeration to say that you were trapped in a labyrinth.
  &lt;/div&gt;

    In 1970, the Busan National Museum opened in Busan. As the amount of artifacts increased, the exhibition of Baekje widened as it moved to Geumseong Mountain and opened again. It consists of 4 permanent exhibition halls and an outdoor exhibition hall. Today, about 1,000 artifacts are on display.

   Let&#39;s walk from the bronze age. The Bronze Age village was modeled on the basis of the excavation of the first exhibition room and the excavation of Songguk-ri, Buyeo.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   Through relics such as a half moon stone sword, gandol sword, and earthenware, it is outlined how the daily life of prehistoric times would have been. As you move through the Iron Age, you can see the relics of Buyeo&#39;s original Three Kingdoms period.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   Compared with the cheats ceremony, the Korean-style swords have a straighter body and distinct nodes. Based on this shape, the iron sword of the Iron Age shows a similar form.

   Gopeunok is one of the relics that are frequently found in sarcophagus with copper sword. It is highly likely that the pair was found as a pair of ornaments polished with Cheon Ha-seok. Given that such a pattern appeared until the end of the Iron Age, I guess it was the &#39;fashionable&#39; of Buyeo at the time.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   The peculiar appearance is the best among the artifacts with its unusual appearance. The convex shape is armed with a shallow curve, and the symmetry is distinct from top to bottom, left and right, and the elaborate pattern is free from disturbance. Besides, it is neat until the deadline. This motive is said to be a relic supporting the fact that Buyeo was related to shamanism around Siberia.

   Baekje&#39;s Sabindo Island and Destruction
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Exhibition Hall 2 is full of stories of Baekje and Sabiseong. First, let&#39;s briefly talk about &#39;Sabi (Buyeo) Cheondo&#39;. King Dongseong of Baekje, who was living in Woongjin (Princess), was looking for a place to build a better capital. The first place he wanted was the Han River basin. However, it was not as easy as it was to regain the lost Han River to a stable land. In the Three Kingdoms, the king of the same city directed the king to build a castle by sending entourage to Xabi, and it is said that he often hunted in Xabi. This is where the possibility that the king of Dongseong might have noticed Xabi was raised. After reaching King Muryeong and King Seongwang, he planned to relocate the city based on the strengthened kingship and to prepare the foundation for re-leaping to Sabi. In the 16th year of King Seongwang, Cheondo was promoted and the national name was changed to &#39;Nambuyeo&#39;.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    Unlike the provinces, Buyeo has been developed with a special system called &#39;5 parts, 5 clauses&#39;. The capital was divided into 5 parts (upper part, front part, middle part, lower part, and rear part), and each section had 5 sections to strengthen the kingship through careful management. One of the five parts, the stone engraved with &#39;All&#39;, is the remains of the entrance to the second exhibition hall.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   A thick matte black, multiple legs reminiscent of a strong calf… When I saw what kind of work it was, I was impressed. I think that the exterior that felt great was called &#39;Bam-Ru&#39;, so it was too cool. Then, where did you write the grind?

   Many records of Baekje are transmitted through stones or trees. In 1300, even hard stones became dull, making it difficult for the engraved letters to become difficult to recognize. Nevertheless, there is a record on the wood that is vulnerable to corrosion, so it is said to be &#39;wooden&#39;.

   National Treasure No. 287 Baekje Geumdong Daehyangro
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In October 1993, South Korea&#39;s attention was drawn to the bottom of the paddy field. It was the moment when the Baekje Geumdonghyangro was seen in the soil by the excavation team of the National Buyeo Museum. Experts did not hide the surprise by saying that the excavation was a &#34;miracle.&#34; This preciousness crossed the gap of 1300 and provided the opportunity for the pale pulse of Baekje to re-pulse.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The National Treasure No. 287, Baekje Geumdonghyanghyang, literally burns incense. It is believed to have been used for rituals related to Buddhism, a national religion at the time, and is a 6th-century work made of bronze as a main material. It consists of a lid, a body, and a base. It is 61.8 in height and 11.85 kg in weight, which is a relatively large part of the censer.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I looked at the censer from top to bottom. At the top of the lid, the phoenix with its wings spread out stands with Yeouiju in its mouth, and below it, there are five mountain peaks and a musical instrument with different freshness between them. It is said that this is a reproduction of an ancient story related to Phoenix. Underneath, there are 27 animals of water, land, and sky, such as fish, deer, and cranes. Below the body is a dragon-shaped base. It is said that the appearance of this dragon is a representative form that was expressed in the ancient times of Korea. I remember seeing a similar dynamic and mysterious atmosphere somewhere, and it feels like a dragon in the Goguryeo tomb murals.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The inner world contained in it as much as the exterior of the incense burner is also full of emotion. It can be seen that the phoenix is a representative of Yin and Yong-Yang and contains the Yin-Yang Pavilion. It is also said that the number 5, which overlaps 5 fresh and 5 mountain peaks, originated from the Five Elements. In addition, as can be seen from the 5th and 5th Control of Baekje, there seems to be a close relationship between Baekje and 5.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   Blooming Buddhism in Buyeo
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is known that the Buddhist culture of Baekje after reaching Xavi was reached its peak. Now, it remains unfortunate that it remains as a limb and a dead area and only traces of traces. Artisan works found there, Buddhist artifacts of Baekje that reached their peak, were mainly dealt with in the third exhibition room. It is a pity to take a closer look.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    Square tiles depicting goblins attract attention. This is an artifact presumed to be a roof tile that was attached to the end of the skeleton of a roof with a rectangular cross section. Considering that these woods were used, one can guess that there were buildings with unique construction techniques. In the three-dimensional expression, the dignity is conveyed as if life is alive.

    Some of the artifacts over the glass are small pieces that are put together like debris, but when I stand in front of it, I feel uncomfortable. On the contrary, the more vivid the expression, the more delicate the pattern, the more precious it is and the more sophisticated the aesthetic sense of ancestors looks. As I watched, the image of the Baekje relics was strong enough to reach the glass wall several times. Like living.
   &lt;/p&gt;
