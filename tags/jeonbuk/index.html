            I was worried about the news of the rain all night, but the rain slowly faded away from the highway. I was in a hurry because I wanted to enjoy the morning scenery of the green barley field. The festival tastes good when it's too waxy, but I still wanted to go back to the green barley field. When I had the chance, I wanted to see the fog that covered the barley field and the sun rising through the fog. Gochang-gun, Jeonbuk, Korea. Korea Tour

In this school, reopened as a book village, numerous stories of “writing together” are written on paper. It's our ordinary but precious story. Gochang-gun, Jeonbuk, Korea. Korea Tour

            In winter, mountaineers who want to enjoy snowy country from skiers become paralyzed. However, Muju is a good trip even for those who do not have eye contact. This is because there are various places to see and eat that were not thought. I am meeting the charm of Muju hidden for you who are curious about the unique appearance of Muju outside of Deogyusan.

            Different forms of happiness are pursued by people, but the essence is the same. Breathe in the fresh air, eat innocent food, and keep your mind and body healthy. Occasionally, if you feel that little happiness far away, go to Gochang, North Jeolla Province. There is an up and down farm where there is a workshop where you can see healthy food made with reliable ingredients, food production process and various experience programs.

To send military beauty to the battlefield to fill their ambitions. The novelist Jo Jung-rae wrote in Arirang the history of suffering and resistance that the minchos had to face in this process.
