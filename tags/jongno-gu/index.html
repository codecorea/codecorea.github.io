            There is nothing to eat when you go out? The answer to your concern, long or short, is ramen. The national snack ramen, which can be boiled for 4 minutes in a pot, is surpassing the preconception of instant and passing through the prejudice of snacking and emerging as a meal. I visited a four-color delicacy ramen restaurant in downtown Seoul that boils with extraordinary taste and strong nutrition and warm emotional soup. Jongno-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour

            Seochon Village, the nickname for the western village of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Let's take a look at the map before starting a full-scale Seochon village tour. If you want to know where Seochon really refers to, I would recommend a map of the Seoul Castle that was introduced around Inwangsan (338m), Bukaksan (342m), Naksan (125m), and Namsan (262m). Now, the meaning has faded, but the boundary that separates 'inside and out of the city of Hanyang' is this Seoul Castle. Just as modern people in the 21st century want to live in Gangnam, at that time their ancestors probably didn't want to live in the 'Sadaeseongmun'. Jongno-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour

            There are many ways to enjoy a 500-year history tour of Joseon in Seoul. Perhaps one of the first hands is the palace where the king of Joseon Dynasty stayed. The four main palaces in the Joseon Dynasty that remain in Seoul are Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace, and Deoksugung Palace. They open the night landscape under the name of night viewing. Jongno, Daehak-ro, and Gwanghwamun walk through the downtown of Seoul, and the night view of the palace that passed by is very popular. That's because it closes as soon as you start buying tickets every night. If you missed this special tour, take a look at the day and night scenery of the palace and try your next special tour. Clearly, it is our proud history that is unfortunate and unfortunate to see only at night. Jongno-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour
