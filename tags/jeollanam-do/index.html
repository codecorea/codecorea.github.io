            Last winter, a “sky bridge” was built on the Baek-Asan Mountain in Hwasun, Jeollanam-do, connecting the Madang Rock and the Temple Rock. Like the name of the sky bridge, it splits the air between two tall towering rocks at the same time. Before the sky bridge was laid, Baek-Asan was known to hikers for its name, but it was unfamiliar to the public. When the news that a total of 66m of the sky bridge was laid, he went on a tour of both sides. After trekking, I decided to soothe my fatigue at Hwasun Hot Spring, which is located on the ground. I also looked forward to spring news from Namdo and headed for Hwasun. Hwasun-gun, Jeollanam-do, Korea. Korea Tour

            Everyone experiences the end in life. There are various ends, such as a scheduled one and a sudden one, but it is difficult to get used to it. It would be a similar context if we wanted to go to the 'end of the earth' at least once. Because I have the expectation that I can start again after seeing the end of the earth and walking again. Following the expectation, people gather from Seoul to Cheonni-gil, so the land was once abandoned. Haenam-gun, Jeollanam-do, Korea. Korea Tour

However, when he calls his name, which starts from the name, “Kokmak”, born and raised in the volcanic Namdo tidal flat, turns on. Regardless of where you come from, it's just nice to be a kid, but there is no way to hide your excitement because the best companion “Beolgyo” is added. 'Bolgyo Komak', called the highest peak of Komak. How can we turn away from having a small festival there? In the autumn wind, a real cold energy is added, so we go to Bolgyo in season.
