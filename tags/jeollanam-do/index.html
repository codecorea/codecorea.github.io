            If you go from Naju to the West Sea with the Yeongsan River next to you, you encounter an unexpected past. As the old you and the roof gathered at the foot of a mountain, whose name is unknown, and old structures such as castle walls and watchtowers caught the eye, it was indispensable as a travel journalist. This time, we introduce every corner of Naju's treasure, Naju Video Theme Park, which is wrapped around the Yeongsan River. We need to capture the impression of the drama, the scenery of the Naju Plain, and the Yeongsan River, so let's get a big basket called slack. Naju Video Theme Park began to become famous as the location of Jumong, opened as Samhanji Theme Park, and was renamed as 'Naju Video Theme Park' after undergoing massive remodeling. It is the largest in Korea at about 140,000m2 and has been visited by about 1 million visitors. Inside the park, more than 100 buildings are structured for each theme, and the grandeur of the palace is also outstanding. Naju-si, Jeollanam-do, Korea. Korea Tour

            It's a good time to walk with a breeze of autumn. Let's go on a good Damyang moonlight trip before the wonderful season disappears. The moonlight walk in the autumn night is sweet and savory like a chestnut that is burned on a campfire. The Moonlight Sonata in Damyang walks along the 'cloud-painted moonlight' from the Dambit Art Warehouse to Gwanbangjerim to Juknokwon, is an emotional journey to spend the autumn.

            Last winter, a “sky bridge” was built on the Baek-Asan Mountain in Hwasun, Jeollanam-do, connecting the Madang Rock and the Temple Rock. Like the name of the sky bridge, it splits the air between two tall towering rocks at the same time. Before the sky bridge was laid, Baek-Asan was known to hikers for its name, but it was unfamiliar to the public. When the news that a total of 66m of the sky bridge was laid, he went on a tour of both sides. After trekking, I decided to soothe my fatigue at Hwasun Hot Spring, which is located on the ground. I also looked forward to spring news from Namdo and headed for Hwasun. Hwasun-gun, Jeollanam-do, Korea. Korea Tour

However, when he calls his name, which starts from the name, “Kokmak”, born and raised in the volcanic Namdo tidal flat, turns on. Regardless of where you come from, it's just nice to be a kid, but there is no way to hide your excitement because the best companion “Beolgyo” is added.
