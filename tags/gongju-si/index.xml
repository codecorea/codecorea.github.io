    King Gaero, who fell in love with King Jangsu, reached a miserable end under Achasanseong Fortress, and the grand Hanseong Baekje eventually collapsed. Woongjin is the place where King Munju of Baekje newly established the city. It is the princess now. It was a place where Baekje enjoyed its heyday for over 60 years until the city was moved back to Buyeo. In Gongju, there are Gomanaru scenic spots where you can walk around the history of Baekje, such as Gomanaru, Songsan Rigogun, and Communist Castle. Let&#39;s take a walk on Komanaru Myeongseung-gil where you can see the history of Baekje at once.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;strong class=&#34;ar_title&#34;&gt;
   The beginning of princess history, Komanaru with a sad legend
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There is Gomnaru on the riverside of the princess. Woongjin, the old name of the princess, came from right here. Now called Komanaru, ‘Goma’ is the old term for ‘bear’, and the name of the princess starts here. A legend about bears and humans descends on Gomnaru. A female bear was living in Yeonmi Mountain, across from Gomnaru, where she caught a fisherman who caught a fish in Gomnaru and lived with her and gave birth to her young. One day, when a fisherman ran across the river and fled, the abandoned bear was sad and died in the water with the young. Since then, no fish have been caught in the river, and the Buddha has continued, such as death. People say that they built a bear shrine and sacrificed to relieve the grudge. It is a legendary story, but in fact, in 1975, a stone bear statue was discovered near Gomnaru. It is held every year at Woongshindan, located between the forests of Gomnararu. The excavated bear statue can now be found at the National Princess Museum. It is as cute as if you are folding your ears and floating a sheep.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   It is no wonder that the starting point of Gomanaru Myeongseung-gil is the Gomnaru, the birth of the princess. In Woongshindan, there is a bear statue, so the legend from the past feels like reality. Behind Woongsindan is a lush pine forest. As a reminder of the Gomnararu legend, you can find sculptures of female bears carrying two cubs all over the forest.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   Komanaru was designated as the number 21 scenic spot with a beautiful landscape, with a beautiful sandy beach along with Mt. However, now it is a pity that Gongju Bo was lost and the sandy beach was lost. Still, there is a beautiful pine forest. Beautiful pine trees that are full of red energy flutter randomly.

   Upon exiting Gomanaru, you will meet Gongju Hanok Village, the National Princess Museum, and Songsan Rigogun where King Muryeong is asleep. Gongju Hanok Village is a traditional hanok made of pine and cedar wood. In addition to various accommodation spaces, Hanok Village has an experience space where you can enjoy various traditional cultures, such as making props from Baekje artifacts and weaving Baekje books, and restaurants where you can enjoy traditional Korean cuisine, Gongju Gukbap, and night food. This is the best place to spend a day at Gongju and enjoy leisurely.

   Aside from the museum road leading through the museum to the remains of Jeongjisan Mountain, and the Gomanaru Myeongseung-gil, such as the Muryeong Wangreung-gil, Gomanaru-gil, and Gongsanseong-gil, it is worth walking along the Gongju Hanok Village. In particular, the remains of Jeongji Mountain, which meet through the back road of the National Princess Museum, are presumed to be the remains of a memorial service held at the national level during the Baekje period. Although it was hidden by the main ruins of the princess, such as the communist castle and Songsan Ligogun, it is designated as a historic site No. 474, so it is worth a visit. When you climb to the ruins of Jeongjisan, which is located on the Jeongjisan Tunnel, you can see the magnificent view of the communist castle in harmony with the old town of Baekje and the Geumgang Railway Bridge.

   National Princess Museum and Songsan Rigogun Meet Baekje in the Ungjin Era
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   The National Princess Museum and Songsan Rigogun are indispensable places in Gongju. It is a place where you can meet the ruins of King Muryeong, representing the princess. The protagonist who bloomed the brilliant culture of the Ungjin era was King Muryeong. The discovery of the tomb of King Muryeong was a landmark event in Korea&#39;s archaeological excavations. Reminiscent of a drama from accidental discovery to excavation, King Muryeong awakened from a long sleep of more than 1,500 years. The tomb of King Muryeong was discovered in July 1971. It was the beginning of the great discovery that the water infiltrated inside the No. 6, which had been stolen during the Japanese occupation during the heavy rain, and then digged a ditch and caught it at the end of a shovel. It was a great excavation in the history of Korea and the first excavation of a Korean archaeologist, but the light of the world received by the king and queen, who had been asleep for many years, was not a warm sunlight, but a dazzling flash baptism. Even though I only collected artifacts all night, I wasn&#39;t in the name of excavating myself, but I am glad that I can calmly appreciate the many artifacts of Baekje&#39;s soul 1,500 years ago at the National Princess Museum.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   The National Princess Museum, which you can meet right after passing through Gongju Hanok Village, is the first place to visit before visiting the princess of the Ungjin era. The museum consists of the Royal Tomb of King Muryeong, the ancient culture room of Chungnam, and an outdoor exhibition hall. Among the 4,600 relics excavated in the Royal Tomb of King Muryeong, there are various authentic artifacts such as masonry and cemetery, gold and gold crown ornaments of the king and queen, earrings, dangling, and bracelets.

   Don&#39;t just look at the relics, but also look at the colorful patterns engraved on them. The phrase “Simple, but not shameful, but luxurious,” in “The Three Kingdoms Journal”, “The Baekje Book,” comes to my heart.

   Entering the back road of the National Princess Museum leads to Songsan Rigogun. In the Songsan Rigogungun, seven tombs are gathered together. Among the seven tombs, King Muryeong and King Muryeong are sleeping. From the entrance to the tomb of the tomb, there are two tombs in front of it, the tomb of King Muryeong. During the Japanese colonial rule, a Japanese named Karube Zeon excavated the sixth tomb of King Muryeong. Fortunately, he did not consider the bonbon behind him as a royal tomb. Fortunately, his misjudgment prevented the robbery and looting of the tomb of King Muryeong. Thanks to that, I could feel the traces of Baekje 1,500 years ago.

   The Songsan Ligobun must first look around at the model exhibition hall. This is because you cannot actually see the interior of Songsan Rigogun. The royal tomb of King Muryeong also opened its interior, and a permanent decision was made in 1997 to protect the tomb. Inside the model building, there is an internal model of No. 6 where Muryeong Royal Mausoleum as well as Sasindo murals were found. If you look around the model building, take a look around the tomb. On the gentle uphill, the lower 3rd and upper 4th are gathered. When you stand at the observatory at the end of the tomb of Kofun, you can see the communist castle at a glance, and overlook the tumulus that rises soaking up Chaejuksan and Geumgang.

   Communist Castle meets accumulated history from Baekje to Joseon

  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When you leave Songsan Rigogun, you will reach the communist castle through the stork rock sanctuary, Jemincheon, and the acid market. The communist castle was the royal castle of Baekje, which was enshrined in Woongjin. It was called Gongjusanseong Fortress in the Goryeo Dynasty and Ssangsusanseong Fortress in the Joseon Dynasty. Using the Geumgang as a natural moat, it was built as Saturn in the Baekje period, and now it is Seokseong built in the Joseon Dynasty.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   As for the way to visit the communist castle, there are courses in Wanju, starting at Geumseoru, then going back to Geumseoru through Jinnamru, Gwangbokru, Manharu, and Gongbukru. There are also courses that come. Most of them use the latter a lot. After the selection fee of officials who went through the princesses of the Joseon Dynasty, such as judges, observers, and pastors, it is a golden rush. If you climb a short uphill in the counter-clockwise direction, you can meet the Estimated Royal Palace and Ssangsujeong. The slope of the rampant wall is curved with an S-shape, making it a beautiful landscape.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   It is said that Ssangsujeong was the place where the Joseon Dynasty descended from Irk&#39;s egg and stayed there, and it was said that they were thrilled with the two big trees that were standing as escorts to Ssangsujeong in joy when the egg was suppressed. Cherry blossoms and fresh greens are bright in spring, and autumn leaves are beautiful in autumn. The large space in front of Ssangsujeong is the presumed royal palace of Baekje, and traces of buildings and ponds remain.

   Within the communist castle, there is another pond like the one in front of Ssangsujeong. That&#39;s Yeonji, located on Manharu, facing the Geumgang River. The uniquely created terraced Yeonji goes well with Manharu. Looking up from the top of the road to Gwangbokru or Gongbukru, it becomes a picture-like landscape. From Manharu to Gongbukru and climb to the observatory, you can see the flowing Geumgang River and Gongju New Town at a glance. It is a steep downhill stairway from the observation deck to Geumseoru, but it is the last observation point in the communist castle.

   Komanaru Myeongseung-gil is a 23km road that starts from Gomanaru and goes back to Gomanaru through Songsan-gobungun, Gongsanseong Fortress, and Yeonmisan Mountain, but it is not necessary to walk through the entire section. You can also rent a bicycle at the bicycle rental center located on the other side of the parking lot of the communist castle, and enjoy the Komanaru scenic spot by using a bicycle course from Communist Castle to Jeongancheon, Geumgangbyeon, and Gongjubo and returning to Komanaru. You can rent a bicycle for free through cell phone authentication, and you can ride up to 2 hours per time (Gongju Bicycle Call Center 041-856-1027).

    People&#39;s preconceptions are terrifying. If you have a fixed perspective on one thing or thing, you don&#39;t think well in other ways. The same goes for people&#39;s thoughts about princesses. Because it is well-known as the capital of Baekje, only the ruins of Baekje, such as the Royal Mausoleum of King Muryeong and the communist castle, are thought of, but do not think about the remains of other times. In Gongju, there are artifacts and remains of each period, from prehistoric cultural relics prior to the Three Kingdoms period to Goryeo and Joseon. Nevertheless, people are not interested in these ruins, so they may be victims of Baekje history.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;strong class=&#34;ar_title&#34;&gt;
   The Seonhwadang was the Chungcheong Provincial Office
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   The starting point for the modern architecture of Gongju is Seonhwadang. On the right side of the National Princess Museum, you can see the Palace of Archery and the Sunhwadang is opposite. Seonhwa (宣化) means &#39;to reveal the virtue of the king and spread it widely and edify the people&#39;. The Seonhwadang, which has an impressive lawn, is where the Chungcheong-do observer watched the affairs. Today, it is a metropolitan city that covers Daejeon and Chungcheong-do. During the Joseon Dynasty, Chungcheong Gamyeong was a local base in the Hoseo region, which shoulders Yeonghonam. At the time of its creation, it was 9 squares on the front and 5 squares on the side, but now it has been reduced to 8 squares on the front and 4 squares on the side. It was used as a display for the old National Princess Museum in 1937, and then moved to its present location when the museum moved in 1992.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   The pavilion on the second floor seen from the front is Pojeongsa, the main gate of the Sunhwa Party. The lower floor was used as a doorway with a large door, and the upper floor was used as a pavilion. Until the Japanese colonial rule, it was used as the main gate of the Gongjusadaebugo. As you climb the pavilion, you can see the pine garden and Sunhwadang at a glance. The building lined up between Sunhwadang and Pojeongsa is Dongheon. This is the place where the observer tried the trial after seeing administrative affairs. The unpretentious elegance blends with the pine gardens on both sides.

   The second course, the old Gongju-eup office, is impressive with red bricks. It looks like a matchbox, so it can be seen that it is a modern building even at a glance. This building was where Gongju was in charge of administration in the process of transitioning from the center of local administration to the educational city. It is a space that shows the biggest change of the princess.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   Since it was founded as the Chungnam Financial Association Federation Hall in 1920, the Gongju-eup Office and Gongju were promoted to Poems from 1930 to 1985, and were used as city halls. As it is currently under construction, it is impressive that the surroundings are cluttered and the four circular pillars visible in the front and the circular windows are arranged symmetrically. The arched entrance, reminiscent of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, is said to be typical of classical architecture. After the construction of a citizen&#39;s shelter behind the building, the construction seems to be a great history education ground.

   Walk about 10 minutes from the old Gongju-eup office to the back of Bonghwan-dong and you can meet the Gothic Gongju First Church. It is sandwiched between modern buildings, but it doesn&#39;t look very old, but it was the first Methodist church in the southern part built in 1930 with red brick. During the Korean War, it was damaged a lot, but the walls and chimneys have been preserved, and there are traces of time. The building year is marked on the wall of the building. Under the spire, the letters engraved as &#39;worship party&#39; are strange, but the feeling goes up.

   The interior of Gongju First Church was decorated as a museum. The first floor is a “pilgrimage path of sharing,” where photos and artifacts of the members of Gongju First Church are displayed. On the second floor, “Gospel History Road”, after the establishment of the church, it exhibits materials that can reflect contributions and achievements to the nation and society. Internet (

   If you turn your foot to the highest point in the country, you will see the Middle East Cathedral with Gothic bell tower. It was the French missionary Jean Peter, who preached Catholicism to the princess. The cathedral building was completed in 1936 by Father Choi Jong-cheol, who served as the head of the church in 1921, designed a model of Seoul&#39;s Yakhyeon Cathedral. The cathedral, priests, and convent were held on May 12 of the following year, but only the main hall and priests remain.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   The main hall follows the Gothic style that was popular in the Middle East and West. The red bricks were carefully raised one by one, and the entrances and windows of the entrance were decorated with arches, emphasizing the vertical elements while adding softness. It seems somewhat dark when entering the room, but the light coming through the vitrification (stained glass) creates a sacred atmosphere. It is as if the world outside the cathedral is separated from the inside. Because of this vitrification, the interior of the cathedral may be a sacred and noble place.
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;img_typeBox typeFix clfix&#34;&gt;

   What stands out is not just vitrification. The pillars of stone are also colorful. The stone pillars sculpted in an octagon facing each other side to side give an exotic feeling that cannot be seen in traditional wooden structures. The Priest Building is a two-story building that is well-symmetrical. As Catholicism entered the inland of Chungcheong-do through the west coast, a modern cathedral was built, and the Middle East Cathedral is one of them, yet has a classical beauty.

   The Chungcheongnam-do History Museum facing the Middle East Cathedral and a road is also indispensable. The old trees in the yard are in harmony with the red brick building, giving a feeling of old. It is a building that adds traditional elements to modern architecture. In 1971, it was used as a National Princess Museum to collect and display artifacts excavated from Songsan-ri Ancient Tombs, and now it is used as a Chungcheongnam-do History Museum. The museum exhibits historical materials and folklore items from the Joseon Dynasty to the modern era, as well as the relics of Yoon Jeung and Yun Jeung-ga, the leaders of Soron in the Joseon Dynasty.

   Walking along the side street of the History Museum, you can see Yeongmyeong Middle and High School. There is a three-story house on the hill behind the school. This house overlooking the city of Gongju is a missionary house. In 1921, American missionary Sharp and his wife, Sharp Alice (Korean name Saarishi), lived there. Perhaps because of the exclusion of a Korean citizen, he was unable to build a house near the village and built a house on a hill far away. Still, it is a symbolic place that took root in modern education during the gloomy Japanese occupation. Saarisi founded the modern school Myeongseon Women&#39;s School in Gongju in 1905. The missionary house was also used as a dormitory for Kongju National University of Education. Currently, it is a privately owned house, so you cannot see inside.

   The final answer to the modern architecture trip is the Geumgang Steel Bridge next to Communist Castle. The first bridge across the Geumgang of Gongju was “Dongguchunnung”, a bridge that was installed only in winter. In 1984, the Japanese made a public road leading to Jochiwon and Cheongju by connecting the bridges, making the way for the Japanese-Japanese War. Subsequently, for the convenience of colonial policy, the Japanese government moved the location of the metropolitan government to the place where the railway passes. Public opinion about the relocation of the Chungnam Provincial Office was raised by Japanese residents in Daejeon since 1910. In November 1930, when the relocation of the city hall became visible, people in the Gongju area campaigned against it. In response to this, Daejeon and Cheonan areas launched a campaign to attract metropolitan government. At the time, the newspaper even commented, &#34;The five men are arguing over one pretty parasite.&#34;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   In 1931, the Chungnam Provincial Government&#39;s relocation to Daejeon was finalized, and the following year, the provincial government moved from Gongju to Daejeon. The Governor-General of Korea opened a new route between Gongju and Daejeon and constructed the Geumgang Steel Bridge in order to prevent the opposition of the citizens of Gongju following the relocation of the government. At that time, the Geumgang Railway Bridge was called the “Longest Bridge in the South of the Han River,” and the Gongju area became an opportunity to develop into a transportation hub.

   It was called ‘Chunmagok Chugapsa (春 麻 谷 秋 甲 寺)’. This means that the beauty of the season is Magoksa in spring and Gapsa in autumn. As such, the spring scenery of Magoksa Temple is beautiful enough to pick up. In the beautiful scenery, the Magoksa Temple Solbaram Road, which consists of three courses, Baekbeom-gil, Meditation Trail, and Songlim Forest Trail, was created. Take a walk with Magoksa Temple on the meditative walking trail, which is the beauty of Magoksa Temple Solbaram-gil.

   After passing the busy shopping street at the entrance to Magoksa Temple, Magokcheon Stream runs side by side and leads you to Magoksa Temple. When Magokcheon winds up one round like a Taegeuk pattern, it reaches the grounds of Magoksa Temple. Magoksa Temple is a millennium study founded by Jajangyulsa during King Munmu of Silla. It has been said that a lot of horses grew up in the valley of Taehwasan, where Magoksa Temple was inhabited.

   Magoksa Temple is a temple with a long history, so you can&#39;t look around at any one. There are Yeongsanjeon, Daeungbojeon, Daegwangbojeon, and Five-storied Pagoda designated as treasures in the precincts, and Haetalmun, Cheonwangmun, Myeongbujeon, National History Hall, Eungjinjeon, Simgeumdang, and Gobang are designated as cultural properties.

   Among them, Daekwang Preservation is one of many places to see and it is good to take a slow tour. First, the plaque of Daekwangbojeon, which shows brilliant technique, is known as the writing of Pyoam Kang Se-hwang. Kang Se-hwang is well-known as a representative of the late Joseon Dynasty, and an instructor of Hong-do Kim. Inside the Daekwangbojeon Hall, you can meet the Virozana Buddha, which sits toward the east rather than the south, such as the Museoksujeon in Buseoksa in Yeongju or Daeungjeon in Yeonggwangbulgapsa. Behind the post-war paintings, there is the Suwol Baekwan Gwaneumdo in white clothes. In addition, there are 16 Nahan and Sichuan kings as well as various landscape paintings inside and outside Daekwang Preservation. This is because Magoksa has many masters who draw paintings in the center of the southern pixel, the great veins of Buddhist art.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   In Daekwangbojeon, there is also a story of a nest made of oak bark. It is a story that a person with a disease of the sick had a place for 100 days in order to offer to the Buddha, and walked leisurely after taking the place on the 100th day. It is a story that the Buddha impressed with his sincerity and showed his grace.

   The writings of the Joseon Dynasty also remain. That&#39;s the signboard of Yeongsanjeon at the entrance of Magoksa Temple. When King Sejo visited Magoksa Temple to see Kim Si-pup, who is one of the incarnations, and he couldn&#39;t meet, he left the plaque of Yeongsanjeon and his kiln. When King Sejo seized the throne, it was Kim Si-seop, a monthly fan who cried while burning books. Sejo&#39;s regrettable desire to meet and meet him is buried. As Yeongsanjeon is currently being dismantled, it is impossible to see the plate, and it is difficult to see Sejo&#39;s kiln.

   Magoksa Temple stands at the top of Daekwangbojeon and shows a very unique arrangement. When you go up the stairs behind Daekwangbojeon, there is a huge Daeungbobojeon standing like a 2nd floor pavilion. Looking down the grounds from the stairs, the roof line of the building is very beautiful in the direction of Simgeumdang and Gobang.

   Magoksa Temple also retains the traces of Baekbeom Kim Gu. Kim Gu escaped from prison while he was serving as a murderer for the murder of a Japanese army lieutenant who misunderstood Empress Myeongseong. In 1946, shortly after liberation, the teacher visited Magoksa Temple and planted juniper trees on the grounds. At that time, a planted juniper tree stands for 60 years, standing beside Eungjinjeon.
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   At the foot of Mt. It is aka “Baekbeom Meditation Road”. This is the path that Kim Gu walked while hiding in Magoksa Temple. Magoksa Solbaram-gil consists of three courses. Course 1 is a 3km course that departs from Magoksa Temple and returns to Magoksa Temple after passing through Kim Saekbalteo and Gunwangdae. Course 2 is a meditation walkway starting from the parking lot of Magoksa Temple and going down to Magoksa Temple through natural pine bath, Baengnyeonam, Hwainbong, and Saenggol Village. It is 10km from Bong, Traditional Buddhist Cultural Center, and Gunwangdae to Magoksa Temple. It is a place where people of all ages, men and women can come and go, and can see the impressive pine forest path and traces of Baekbeom Kim Gu.

   Course 1 starts with a tour of the Magoksa temple grounds and a tour of the juniper trees planted by Kim Gu. If you pass by the side road of the juniper tree, you will wind up around Magoksa and meet the flowing Magokcheon. Along the road that runs alongside Magokcheon, there is a Baekbeom Kim Gu teacher Shakbalteo. It is said that the teacher was imprisoned for the murder of the Japanese army and escaped from Magoksa-ro and became a monk.
   &lt;br/&gt;
   “The priest Ho Deok-sam brought a knife to cut his hair. I went out to the stream and crushed the shaved mantra, and my coat fell on the sand. I have already made up my mind, but tears fell like my hair. ” At that time, the record remains in the Baekbeom Ilchi. The fresh green along the waterside of Magokcheon is beautiful. It seems that the first spring came with the bite of Magokcheon.

   Leaving Kim&#39;s shackle ground and crossing Baekbeom Bridge, the road leads straight to the mountain. The entrance is rather flat. The winter is still dim, and the pine trees have fallen all over the place due to the typhoon that hit last year. However, even for a while, if you walk uphill for about 10 minutes, a group of pine trees stretched out through the pine forests are spreading out.

   The pine tree here is not a Rigida pine tree that grows straight, but is a representative pine tree in Korea that shows off its curves. The footsteps are so good that they will not fall for a while. The pine forest path and the rhododendron colony that extend over 500m are the beauty of Baekbeom-gil.

   If you get drunk at the pine forest, you will soon reach the army. The Gunwangdae is named after the king of the military, and is the strongest place around Magoksa Temple. When the Joseon King Sejo stopped by Magoksa Temple, he said, “I am the king of a country, but I can&#39;t compare it to this place where I live in the world.”
