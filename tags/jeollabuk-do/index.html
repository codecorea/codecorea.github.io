            In the season when the warmth is missed, go to the street of Ssanghwacha in Jeongeup, where you can smell Gujeolcho. The heartache floating in my head dries up in a cup of hot Ssanghwa-tang, and the weight of everyday life when I press my shoulders becomes loose. If you eat the sweet chestnuts and jujube contained in the dark Ssanghwatang, you will feel as if you were in vain. If a warm cup of hot water delivered to a goblet teacup and a cup of sweet Ssanghwa-tang warms the body gently, it can withstand the chilly weather and the harsh world.

            Gunsan is a modern historical city. There are many red houses with traces of the Japanese colonial rule all over the old city center, and there are many cultural heritages such as Gujosun Bank, Gugun San Customs, and Museum of Modern History. You can also meet the old railroad tracks that were being robbed of rice wine. However, this trip is not a tour of Gunsan's modern cultural heritage. It is a so-called “Mokja Travel” that searches for all kinds of food, based on the traces of modernity in the old city. In Gunsan, many restaurants that are common on the street easily pass over 40 years of history. The restaurant and Jujeon Buri, which have continued since the liberation, are also boring. History flows on streets, buildings, and railroads, but it also flows vividly on our food. Gunsan-si, Jeollabuk-do, Korea. Korea Tour
