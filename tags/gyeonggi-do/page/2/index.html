            From July 25th to August 2nd, 'Yeoncheon DMZ International Music Festival' will be held in Yeoncheon-gun, Gyeonggi-do for 9 days. The main stage of the festival is the Jeokgok-ri Seonje Historic Site, Hantan River Tourist Site, and Sureul Art Hall. This year, with the theme of “coexistence,” about 40 musicians, including Sook-ryun Park, will produce chords. Orchestra performances, concerts by artists from around the world, fringe concerts, visiting concerts, music academies, and classical lectures are held throughout the music festival. I believe that the feast of beautiful classics created by travelers from Yeoncheon-gun and artists from around the world will greatly contribute to the settlement of peace on the Korean Peninsula.

            In June 1950, the ground rang with a loud bombardment. Han River, Imjin River, Gongneung Stream, and Munsan Stream. Paju, which was called “the village on the bank,” had many roads in Oga. Today, 68 years later, Paju, arising from the pain of a dog-legged bridge, is a space that contains happiness, such as a museum and a garden cafe, touching people's wounds and dreaming of a miracle tomorrow.
