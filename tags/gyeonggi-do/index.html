            When you exit Seojong IC, you will see a village called Munho-ri, Seojong-myeon, Yangpyeong-gun, located along the Bukhan River. At first glance, it doesn't look much different from the surrounding area, but if you look closely, there are treasure-like spaces hidden everywhere. That's why Moon Ho-ri is also called “Hot Place” that emerges from Yangpyeong. There are natural yeast bakeries and Japanese kaiseki cuisine shops that seem to fit into downtown Seoul, and Terrarosa in Gangneung, which is famous for word of mouth nationwide, has also opened in this neighborhood.

            As time goes by, the reality is that the old things are gradually forgotten or disappeared. Moreover, I feel sorry for even forgetting the nostalgia for the old. Though there are no exceptions for the old market, the peony market in Seongnam, Gyeonggi-do, shows the face of the nation's best folk market even in a short history. The peony is an oil field that stands in a crowded city center, and it is enough to inspire nostalgia and curiosity for those who are looking for a market place. The marketplace in the city, there are no objects in it, and there are as many people as there are items for sale. The oil field enjoyed in the city center gives a different scenery.

            I go early in the morning. Soongneung opened this year. Sungneung is the 18th Joseon Dynasty and the tomb of Queen Myeongseong. It has been closed for many years among the nine tombs of the copper hills, and was opened to the public earlier this year. The Sungneung revealed the first fresh green. The road to “Secret Nest” is a cozy forest path that has not been reached by foreigners for a while. The morning forest is deep, and the birdsong is perfect.
