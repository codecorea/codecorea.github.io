In addition to Jeongjo, there was a person who conveyed his endless love for his mother throughout his reign, which is Yeongjo, his grandfather. Sukbin Choi, who went to the palace in Musuri and climbed to Sookbin, the first item in the list, is the mother of Yeongjo and the main character of the drama <Dongi>.

            When it was snowy winter, I visited the morning calm arboretum, a winter kingdom that glistens with a brilliant autumnal glow. Many people visit the arboretum even in this season thanks to the “Five Starlight Garden” held every winter. When the darkness fell, I followed the colored lights blooming. It is also suitable for a quiet downtown dating course. A winter festival of lights held at this time of year. The five-pointed starlight garden, which celebrated its eighth anniversary this year, will continue until March 15, when the vegetation is asleep. Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. Korea Tour

Looking down from the silver grass hill in front of the house, the anxiety disappears. In the autumn outing, a nearby Yongmunsa Temple with 1,100-year-old ginkgo trees is also recommended.

            From July 25th to August 2nd, 'Yeoncheon DMZ International Music Festival' will be held in Yeoncheon-gun, Gyeonggi-do for 9 days. The main stage of the festival is the Jeokgok-ri Seonje Historic Site, Hantan River Tourist Site, and Sureul Art Hall. This year, with the theme of “coexistence,” about 40 musicians, including Sook-ryun Park, will produce chords. Orchestra performances, concerts by artists from around the world, fringe concerts, visiting concerts, music academies, and classical lectures are held throughout the music festival. I believe that the feast of beautiful classics created by travelers from Yeoncheon-gun and artists from around the world will greatly contribute to the settlement of peace on the Korean Peninsula.
