    Isn&#39;t red apple the best jewel in autumn? The red color is more beautiful and charming than Ruby. If you bite a big bite, the juice that soaks your mouth sweetly and the crunchy sound is also excellent. I visited Mungyeong to harvest apples more expensive than jewelry. This is also the time for the Mungyeong Apple Festival. From October 13th to 28th, you can experience Mungyeong apple in various ways at Mungyeong Saejae Provincial Park. Also, if you are looking for an apple festival experience farmer, you can also experience apple picking. Many farmhouses experience it regardless of the festival.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   The apple field I found in October is blue and red. The sky is absolutely blue, and the apples are more red than any autumn leaves. Apple picking is available until the end of October. The busiest varieties, Busa, are harvested in November, but once cooked, they must be picked up and stored in a low-temperature warehouse.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   The varieties that can be experienced these days are red and yellow, which are exceptionally beautiful, while the color is second to none. If there is a beauty pageant in the apple world, the Miss Apple Jean will be the right to do so. The color and shape are pretty.

   Papa&#39;s Farm, one of the farmhouses experiencing the Mungyeong Apple Festival, is less than 5 minutes from Gaeun-eup. After inheriting the orchards of his parents, who had been growing apples for a long time, his son, Kim Jong-ha, became the farmer. Like a young farmer, the sales floor on the side of the road is clean, and it is pioneering sales channels through direct transactions over the Internet.
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   When I step into the apple garden, it feels dazzling and thick. This is because of the reflector on the floor. Since apples ripen red and sugar content rises only after receiving the light, the film that reflects light is spread widely on the floor. That&#39;s why all apples are red evenly, regardless of where they are running.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   When picking apples, be careful not to damage the branches. If you grab the apple and flip it up, it will bounce and fall off easily. There are so many open places that children can enjoy harvesting themselves without the help of their parents.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   For the fun of picking, the children who put them in a few baskets gathered together and said, “I want to eat an apple ~!” do. It would be weird if the saliva did not flow even with an apple like this in front.

   Pick the cutest one and bite it one by one. The cool, sweet juice that flows through your mouth is also nice to hear the crunchy sound. The children cry out, &#34;It&#39;s really delicious!&#34; A thirsty car has no better new stuff than this.

   Apples are good for your health, as there is a saying that &#39;one apple a day does not require a doctor.&#39; It is effective in preventing skin diseases and aging, as well as preventing adult diseases and heart disease. Many people worry about residual pesticides and cut them, but if you wash them well, don&#39;t worry. The apple peel has a lot of dietary fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants that are good for constipation, so you should eat it.

   Also, when eaten at night, gastric juice is secreted, so the stomach may become sore that the words ‘morning apples are golden apples, and evening apples are poison apples’. If you are thinking about your health, eat apples from now on, and take one tablet each morning.

   After the apple picking experience was over, I bought a box containing the apples I picked myself. It&#39;s much fresher and riper than living at a local mart, and it&#39;s also worthwhile since it&#39;s a harvest experience.

    After lunch in the nearby Gaeun-eup, we went to the Ajagae Market. Ajagae was the father of Gyeonhyang who founded the Baekbaekje and was born and worked in this town. Originally, the 4th and 9th are the market days, but the market is open every Saturday from September 29th to October 27th as a special product sale event for autumn.

   It is also within walking distance of Gaeun Station, which became a closed station, and Mungyeong Coal Museum. Gaeun Station has a small history of modern cultural heritage. The Mungyeong Coal Museum, built in the shape of a round coal, shows in detail the process of excavating coal, the use of coal, the life of a coal mine, and the story of a miner. You can also go directly to the Eunseong Coal mine tunnel that was in the past.

   You can ride the rail bike at Gaeun Station. The train tracks are double tracked, but there are not many bicycles, so there are many people waiting on weekends. The scenery is good because it is a course to see the mountains, fields, and red ripening apples. The course takes about 40 minutes round trip.

    Mungyeong Saejae is the highest and steepest bridge connecting Seoul and Yeongnam, and many people have passed through and left many stories. Although Seonbi and Bobusang were mainly visited, there were people who relied on the harsh mountainous landscape of Mungyeong Saejae. In difficult times, they ate rice with field crops and acorns such as jo and mung beans, and the old taste is saejaemukjobap. Let&#39;s enjoy the special taste of Mungyeong Saejae, now a delicacy.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;strong class=&#34;ar_title&#34;&gt;
   People who lived on Mungyeong Saejae, and Somunan Restaurant
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Mungyeong Saejae is a place where people&#39;s footsteps never stop. Although there are no people living inside Mungyeong Saejae now, there were people who leaned on Mungyeong Saejae just a few decades ago. Most of the people who lived in the mountains were able to obtain rice easily because they had farmed fields such as crude, green beans, and red beans. The field crops were sold to the market to buy rice, dried herbs and picked up acorns to save the long winter. Since the situation was so bad, it was difficult to stuff a meal with rice instead of rice. Eating a full meal was harder than a year-round event. Joe, mung beans, and acorns were the food for them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Since ancient times, acorns have been eaten together with grated rice. It also helped to reduce the gluttony of the rice and save food. On the other hand, mung beans were one of the high-quality ingredients that were used to serve precious customers even in poverty. Mung beans were precious and expensive to harvest. It is said that the green beans made from mung beans were one of the foods that were served at the groom&#39;s house when they married. When the daughter was married, the parents took the daughter to her son-in-law and stayed overnight. At this time, at the groom&#39;s house, they prepared snacks and chestnuts, as well as every meal. It was an expression of gratitude for giving a daughter who had been raised for decades to someone else&#39;s house.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Saejaemukjobap is a food that contains the hard life of the people of Mungyeong Saejae. Located at the entrance of Mungyeong Saejae, the &#39;Somun Nansikdang&#39; (054-572-2255) is serving a new jaemu-jok-bap with an old couple who passed over seventy. The story goes back to the 1970s, when the old couple lived in Sangcho-ri, inside the main hall of Mungyeong Saejae. They lived in Mungyeong Saejae and opened a restaurant only 15 years ago. However, it has been over 40 years since I started serving mukjo rice to customers. In the background where Saejae Mukjobab was born, Mungyeong Saejae played a part. In the 1970s, the number of people looking for Mungyeong Saejae increased rapidly, but there was no place to solve a meal. The old couple started to serve to the guests with acorn rice and cheongpo-muk mixed with white rice in the way they always ate. This was the beginning of the rumored restaurant.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    It was also a visitor to Saejae who gave a name to a restaurant that had no name changed. In the mid-1980s, there were people visiting Mungyeong Saejae on the weekend. It was a man who started working at Mungyeong Saejae when his company became difficult and his health worsened while doing a big business in Seoul. Every time he visited Saejae, he placed a shochu and a gun at the Sanshingak under the third gate and bowed in hopes that things would go well. When I came down to Mungyeong Saejae, I always stopped by an old couple&#39;s house and ate rice, but he said that the food tasted good and praised him. Then one day, he named the restaurant, saying it would be okay to have a restaurant. That is the rumored restaurant. It is a restaurant that has already been word of mouth for those who have visited Saejae, so it is used as a trade name.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   Saejae Mukjo Rice with Slow Aesthetics
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The old couple in the rumored restaurant is a natural person leaning against nature. As if we were treated as a precious guest when we lived in Mungyeong Saejae, we still make acorn and cheonpo-muk. Acorns are collected from around Mungyeong Saejae, and mung beans are supplied from Gaeun through contract cultivation. The process of peeling the acorns and mung beans, soaking them in water, grinding them in a millstone, pouring water, and boiling them to make jelly is quite a bit of work for an old couple once or twice a week. When he was young, he said that the acorn shell was also rubbed and steamed directly, and the acorn and mung beans that were soaked were grinded directly on the millstone. Now, the machine is taking the place of peeling and grinding the acorns and mung beans. However, it is still the responsibility of the old couple to boil and steam with a spatula by grinding the acorns and mung beans in a sack and putting them in a large pot. From the couple&#39;s appearance, the skill and devotion of the skilled workers can be seen even after the years have passed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   Watching Cheongpomuk picking, I will see how hard and time-consuming the process is to complete the jelly. Suddenly, I was wondering how many servings would be made if one said mung beans. “Grandpa, how many people can you eat when you pick Cheongpomuk in one green bean?” When he asked, he pondered and said, &#34;I have never thought about it while picking up a jelly.&#34; It is Young Quan who has completed business for more than 40 years and has never considered it. However, the appearance of a spatula stir-free to make a tangled jelly seemed to show the true craftsmanship, “aesthetics of slowness”.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   Various dishes, pickles, and herbs, such as indigenous side dishes, are made by grandmothers with sincere touch. The side dish is the same as the side dish you ate before. People in the city often watch Sae Jae-Mukjobap and ask what kind of side dish it is. If you don&#39;t know the old and old stories hiding in the ordinary life of a mountain village, acorn and apocalypse are just meaningless delicacies for people.

   Mungyeong&#39;s nature and renewable energy experience, Mungyeong Saejae Natural Ecology Hall
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Around Mungyeong Saejae, there are plenty of things to see, such as the Mungyeong Saejae trail leading to Joulek, Jogokwan, and Joryeonggwan, as well as the Mungyeong Ceramics Exhibition Hall at the entrance of Mungyeong Saejae, Confucian Culture Center, Old Road Museum, Mungyeong Omija Experience Center, and Mungyeong Saejae Open Set. Let&#39;s take a look at Mungyeong Saejae Natural Ecology Hall, which is closest to Somunan Restaurant.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The Mungyeong Saejae Natural Ecology Hall consists of two floors. The 1st floor was decorated with a video theater where you can see the nature of Mungyeong as a video, and a new and renewable energy exhibition hall where you can experience new and renewable energy. The second floor is an exhibition space where you can tour various biological resources of Mungyeong from the birth of life. The new and renewable energy exhibition hall is a space where you can feel the importance of new and renewable energy necessary to deal with the energy crisis and experience new and renewable energy. Mungyeong Saejae Natural Ecological Park can monitor the energy produced in real time by utilizing wind, solar, solar, and geothermal heat. In the experience hall, you can experience various renewable energy such as natural light, wind power, solar cars and street lights, and geothermal experience. Under the assumption that there is no electricity, I finally feel the preciousness of energy as I go through a dark tunnel. Around Hwagyewon, there are Hwagyewon, Rock Seokwon, Mandangyiwon, and traditional ponds. There are pavilions, benches, and wooden decks all over the place, making it a good place to stroll.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    The Mungyeong Saejae Natural Ecological Park begins by crossing the bridge at the Mungyeong Saejae ticket office, leading to the first gate of the Mungyeong Saejae, Jouleul. Mungyeong Saejae flower garden, ecological wetlands and ecological ponds, wildflower gardens, and other deck walkways are impressive. On the way down from the end of the visit to Mungyeong Saejae, cross the bridge on the right side after exiting Jujukwan, and you can take a look around Mungyeong Saejae Natural Ecological Park.
