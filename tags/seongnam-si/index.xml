    Is it attracted to analog sensibility in the cutting edge era? You can read an e-book with a smartphone, tablet PC, or dedicated terminal, but it cannot replace the warm feeling of a paper book. Reading a book is more than just reading text, it is an act of combining various elements into one, such as feeling the texture of a paper, turning a bookcase, measuring the thickness of a book, and smelling paper. Turning off your smartphone for a while and opening a book is sometimes a pleasant break. It is in the same context that the two new libraries are welcome. In addition, both libraries have great designs and interiors, and it is even more pleasing to say that collections are rare books that are not easily accessible.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;strong class=&#34;ar_title&#34;&gt;
   The library is full of freshness, Naver Library
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   The Naver Library is located in the Naver office located in Jeongja-dong, Seongnam-si. Right after entering the front door is the library. On the left is a book cafe where you can read various magazines in a more comfortable atmosphere. Libraries are only accessible with ID cards, and food is not allowed. Instead, anyone can go in and out of the book cafe, and enjoy a relaxing reading with fragrant coffee.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   The Naver Library was opened in 2010 as a library specialized in information and communication technology (IT) and design. It was closed for a while last summer, and it was reopened in early November, renovating its internal composition and books.
  &lt;/div&gt;

     There are many green pots around the library, so it&#39;s fresh.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   It is interesting that Naver, the leader of Internet companies leading the era of digitalization and knowledge, has established a library for paper books. It is said that the entire lobby of the office building was made into a library, considering that &#39;Naver&#39;, an online space where people share knowledge, information, know-how or pleasure, and &#39;books&#39; with various stories and experiences resemble each other.
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   The first floor of the library consisted of information desk, locker, new book, design, architecture / interior, and small / independent publishing corner. The design section that occupies the largest area is divided into art, illustration, graphic, and industrial design / UX. The bookshelf is arranged in U, K, K, and so on, making it feel as if you have entered a forest of books. The road that breaks between the bookshelves is winding like a trail. A green plant growing on a bookshelf puts a pot on it, and it actually smells fresh.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   The design book boasts the highest level in Korea, and it is said that it has gathered major design books from around the world to help those working or interested in the design field. Most of the magazines are in book cafes, but design-related magazines are available in the design corner. You can easily find the magazine you want by showing the cover page.

   There are some single-use desks that are great for connecting laptops, and there are also desks that are big enough to open multiple books. It is impressive that desks and chairs are prepared in various designs according to the type of reading.

   The exterior of the library, which incorporates Hanok building techniques to match the Bukchon Hanok Village, attracts attention. Traditional architectural techniques, such as entrances built with black stones, ㅁ -shaped courtyards, windows and girders with Korean paper, are alive everywhere. It is a simple and modern building, and it is a building that utilizes natural light and the beauty of the blank space.

   As the name suggests, the Hyundai Card Design Library focuses on &#39;design&#39;. He has selected over 1,500 books, including rare books and books related to design, from all over the world, along with professional book curators. Above all, in a digital world dominated by speed and efficiency, “Let&#39;s not just react, but take time and time to think.” “The oldest but most vital book offers analog immersion and new inspiration.” The philosophy of Hyundai Card comes to mind.

   The library is a space dedicated to Hyundai Card members. To enter, you must have a Hyundai Card in your name, or you must be accompanied by a member who has a Hyundai Card. It is also interesting that only adults over the age of 19 can enter. After receiving the information from the information desk, leave the bag and enter the exhibition hall. It is a space where various exhibitions, small film festivals, and lectures are held. Now, photo exhibitions are being held by world-class photographers, such as William Eagleston and Nan Goldin, with ordinary digital cameras. Next to the exhibition hall is a book cafe where you can enjoy books with coffee.

   Books are mainly concentrated on the second floor. It is also unique that it has a unique operating system, such as designating a unique color for each field and marking it on a book label. The second floor is divided into 1, 2, and 3 zones.

   There are rare books and designer books in zone 1, brand design and visual communication books in zone 2, industrial design and architecture / space design books in zone 3. The 4th zone on the 3rd floor is equipped with photo books. In rare books, the exhibition books change according to the theme every month, and you must wear gloves to prevent damage to the books. Between the bookshelves, there is an iPad that can search for books or print out the location of books, and there are also sensuous notes and bookmarks made by Hyundai Card.

   The organic connection between book contents and interior is also good. For example, in the book section related to architecture, there is a house-shaped structure, “House in House. In a space that looks like a hanok floor, you can feel the fun of looking out as if unfolding a large architectural drawing and admiring it.

   Reading and relaxing are possible at the same time in a fluffy chair lined up along the window facing the courtyard. There is a small space like an attic next to the photo book on the third floor. Over the roof of the hanok in Bukchon, you can see the skyscrapers of Jongno and Namsan afterwards.

   &lt;p&gt;
    As time goes by, the reality is that the old things are gradually forgotten or disappeared. Moreover, I feel sorry for even forgetting the nostalgia for the old. Though there are no exceptions for the old market, the peony market in Seongnam, Gyeonggi-do, shows the face of the nation&#39;s best folk market even in a short history. The peony is an oil field that stands in a crowded city center, and it is enough to inspire nostalgia and curiosity for those who are looking for a market place. The marketplace in the city, there are no objects in it, and there are as many people as there are items for sale. The oil field enjoyed in the city center gives a different scenery.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;strong class=&#34;ar_title&#34;&gt;
   Korea&#39;s largest folk oil market
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Peony is a place that was given after reclaiming the wasteland around Seongnam in the 1960s and is the place where the history of the peony is held every five days. Busy streets, long tailed vehicles, busy people… . The daily life around Moran Station is no different from any other city, but when the oil field spreads around Moran Station, the city is full of energy. Whether it&#39;s at the entrance of a subway station, at a bus stop, or in the corner of an alley, it&#39;s a market place. This is the largest peony in Korea.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Peony Market&#39;s history is surprisingly short. Unlike the famous oil field with a long history, it is only about 40 years old. The peony market started with Nam-han Kim Chang-suk, who left his mother in Pyongyang. After enlisting in the military, he went through the Korean War and reorganized as a colonel. When people started to gather one by one, they were given the name &#39;Moran&#39;, symbolizing Pyongyang, where their mother lives. After that, as life problems emerged, an oil field was opened, which is said to be the beginning of a peony field.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    It was in the 1980s that the peonies became famous. As the uniqueness of traditional markets in the city became known by word of mouth, many people began to look for it. It is a rumor that is passed from mouth to mouth, so the number of people who want to live and who sells must have increased. Not only that, the peony is more overwhelming in terms of size and items than any other marketplace, and it is hard to even pass by people who fill the marketplace.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;strong class=&#34;ar_title&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The peony field is an oil field held on the 4th and 9th on the 12,000m2 Daewoncheon Bokgaeji. At Exit 5 of Moran Station on the Bundang Line, a noisy field opens. The Peony Folklore Field extends from east to west, and its length exceeds 300m. When you look down from the roof of the building across the main street, you can see the peony folk garden covered in colorful parasols at a glance. It is said that tens of thousands of merchants registered at the Moran Folklore Merchant Association count more than 1,500 people, including those from each region. Moreover, the marketplace is always crowded with customers and visitors who visit the peony market.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The peony field is accurately divided into 14 departments, making shopping easy. Starting with the first flower meet at the market entrance, four to five roads extend from east to west, in the order of grains, herbs, clothing, shoes, sundries, fish, vegetables, food, peppers, dogs, and poultry.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    At the far end of the Moran Folk Farm, the red pepper market forms a block with garlic. It comes from nearby Icheon, Yeoju, and Cheonan, as well as wholesalers, which are quite large compared to other markets. In the 1980s, about 80 merchants gathered and sold peppers in the 1980s. At one time, it was famous enough to say, &#34;The price of red pepper in the metropolitan area is determined at the peony market.&#34; Nowadays, the number of merchants has decreased, but Korean peppers are sold cheaper than those on the market, making Kim Jang-cheol a city.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    The chestnuts piled up on the floor are considered to be the best and are the best princess chestnuts. In order to save the consumer&#39;s trouble, the overnight machine runs continuously. A chestnut that costs 3,000 won per bag comes with a peeling service. Herbs from Paldo, such as Jeollado Gordon, Cheonnamul in Jeju Island, Gondrenamul in Gangwon-do, and Eolsoon, Gyeongsang-do, etc., are packed in red rubber basins, waiting for guests. The name of the herb and the origin of the white corrugated cardboard with bold magic is good. There are some shrimps in good condition in a large plastic bag. It is a barley shrimp from Ganghwa Island. It is said to sell around Goyang, Seongnam, and Anseong in Gyeonggi-do. Even if you just eat it, the barley prawn, which has a savory taste, is topped with more than one fist.

   &lt;p&gt;
    A stinky smell stings the nose. It smells of oil from the oil alley, one of the largest wholesale markets in Korea. There are oils lined up one by one across the house, as well as sesame oil and perilla oil. More than 40 places have started over 40 years ago. In the past, sesame oil was made with domestic sesame seeds, but now mainly made in China. Among 100 bottles of sesame oil, domestic sesame oil is said to be only 1 to 2 bottles. Due to the difference in sesame yield and price, the price of domestic sesame oil is about three times higher than that of Chinese.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Looking inside the oil house of the oil alley is very busy. A machine that roasts sesame seeds to squeeze the oil will run continuously. Most of them use machines, but the operation of bottling oil is semi-mechanical.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    Food cannot be missed in the marketplace. The best food in the peony market is Son Kalguksu. Most of the food department, which has over 40 restaurants, sells hand knife noodles. Knead directly with wheat flour, and if you eat Cheongyang pepper and seasoning sauce, the soup is crisp and crisp and chewy noodles stick to your tongue.
