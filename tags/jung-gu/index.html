            It's fun to see the market even if there is no specific use. Fun to choose a variety of things, to taste a variety of food, and to see people. There is no end to the market views that have a lot of fun. Today, we are going to focus on ‘flavor’, which belongs to the ‘big fun’ of overflowing fun. As it is a representative market in Seoul, a variety of foods overflow. Introducing the more interesting Namdaemun & Dongdaemun taste tour than the market. Let's take a look at Namdaemun Market.
