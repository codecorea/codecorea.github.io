            Old ones always stimulate fragrance. Museums that remodel old warehouses are more attractive than sophisticated museums of high-tech architecture. The Korean Modern Literature Museum opened in the cultural district of Incheon Port, which is filled with modern culture. This is the only literary museum that encompasses Korean modern literature.

            It is an old restaurant, a bar, and a restaurant that keeps its place wherever it comes. There is a familiar taste and a comfortable atmosphere, and stories and stories that have been accumulated for many years flow. It wasn't a national restaurant, but I visited Incheon's oldest restaurants that have shared joy with locals. It's easily accessible by train, and it's also a great day trip because it's easy to visit, including Chinatown, modern cultural heritage, Sinpo International Market, and art platforms.
