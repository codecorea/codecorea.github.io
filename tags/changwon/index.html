            In 1926, during the Japanese colonial rule, Jinhae Station (Registered Cultural Festival No. 192) was established. After the Japanese imperialism, which discovered the geographical importance of Jinhae Bay early on, developed Jinhae as a military port city, it was intended to connect the railway between Jinhae Port and the inland. Jinhae Station had a painful time handling Japanese and military supplies. After the independence, it was used as a major route for the logistics required for passengers as well as national defense. Passenger handling was suspended due to lack of demand in 2015, but the history of local history during the Japanese occupation period remains intact and is being managed as a modern cultural heritage. The journey of Jinhae's modern cultural heritage starts at Jinhae Station and tours around Jungwon Rotary, about 500 meters south. Changwon, Gyeongnam, South Korea. Korea Tour

            From autumn 2013 to winter, the city of Masan got attention again. It is because of the drama <Response, 1994> that sparked a big topic. The family of Najung, the owner of the boarding house, and the garbage, the main character, were all from Masan. In the drama, Masan was often mentioned, and in the meeting scene that gave a big smile, 'Masan's 3rd Gapbu' sons also appeared. As such, in the background of 1994, Masan City existed proudly. At that time, no one would have thought that Masan City would disappear. Masan was a nationwide city in the 1970s and 1980s and the best city in Gyeongnam. However, in July 2010, it was integrated with Changhae City along with Jinhae City, and now exists as Masan Membership District and Masan Happo District within Changwon City.
