            From autumn 2013 to winter, the city of Masan got attention again. It is because of the drama <Response, 1994> that sparked a big topic. The family of Najung, the owner of the boarding house, and the garbage, the main character, were all from Masan. In the drama, Masan was often mentioned, and in the meeting scene that gave a big smile, 'Masan's 3rd Gapbu' sons also appeared. As such, in the background of 1994, Masan City existed proudly. At that time, no one would have thought that Masan City would disappear. Masan was a nationwide city in the 1970s and 1980s and the best city in Gyeongnam. However, in July 2010, it was integrated with Changhae City along with Jinhae City, and now exists as Masan Membership District and Masan Happo District within Changwon City.

            In August 2013, Gyeongsangnam-do submitted a “Application for List of UNESCO World Heritage Temporary Lists” under the heading “Gimhae, Gaya Tumulus in Haman”. The Gaya Tumulus Cluster in Haman, which is trying to be registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was very unfamiliar. Although the area called Haman is an unfamiliar place as a travel destination, the Hagan Gaya Tumulus Cluster is unfamiliar. The term Haman Gaya Tumulus Cluster refers to the mountain tomb cluster. In addition to Geumgwan Gaya, it is the remains of Aragaya, which represents Gaya culture. When it comes to Gaya culture, Gimhae and Goryeong are first thought of, but the Haman Malisan Tumulus Cluster is an open-air museum comparable to the tombs of Gyeongju.

A boy who liked the radio or sewing machine in his house more than a book turned into an eco-artist when he became an adult and made great works of art using abandoned tires, LPG gas cylinders, spark plugs, bolts and nuts. This is to remind children of the importance of nature by creating a second nature from wastes produced by the destruction of nature.
