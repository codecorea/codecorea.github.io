            In 1926, during the Japanese colonial rule, Jinhae Station (Registered Cultural Festival No. 192) was established. After the Japanese imperialism, which discovered the geographical importance of Jinhae Bay early on, developed Jinhae as a military port city, it was intended to connect the railway between Jinhae Port and the inland. Jinhae Station had a painful time handling Japanese and military supplies. After the independence, it was used as a major route for the logistics required for passengers as well as national defense. Passenger handling was suspended due to lack of demand in 2015, but the history of local history during the Japanese occupation period remains intact and is being managed as a modern cultural heritage. The journey of Jinhae's modern cultural heritage starts at Jinhae Station and tours around Jungwon Rotary, about 500 meters south. Changwon, Gyeongnam, South Korea. Korea Tour

            Isn't red apple the best jewel in autumn? The red color is more beautiful and charming than Ruby. If you bite a big bite, the juice that soaks your mouth sweetly and the crunchy sound is also excellent. I visited Mungyeong to harvest apples more expensive than jewelry. This is also the time for the Mungyeong Apple Festival. From October 13th to 28th, you can experience Mungyeong apple in various ways at Mungyeong Saejae Provincial Park. Also, if you are looking for an apple festival experience farmer, you can also experience apple picking. Many farmhouses experience it regardless of the festival. Mungyeong, Gyeongbuk, South Korea.

            From autumn 2013 to winter, the city of Masan got attention again. It is because of the drama <Response, 1994> that sparked a big topic. The family of Najung, the owner of the boarding house, and the garbage, the main character, were all from Masan. In the drama, Masan was often mentioned, and in the meeting scene that gave a big smile, 'Masan's 3rd Gapbu' sons also appeared. As such, in the background of 1994, Masan City existed proudly. At that time, no one would have thought that Masan City would disappear. Masan was a nationwide city in the 1970s and 1980s and the best city in Gyeongnam. However, in July 2010, it was integrated with Changhae City along with Jinhae City, and now exists as Masan Membership District and Masan Happo District within Changwon City.

            In August 2013, Gyeongsangnam-do submitted a “Application for List of UNESCO World Heritage Temporary Lists” under the heading “Gimhae, Gaya Tumulus in Haman”. The Gaya Tumulus Cluster in Haman, which is trying to be registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was very unfamiliar. Although the area called Haman is an unfamiliar place as a travel destination, the Hagan Gaya Tumulus Cluster is unfamiliar. The term Haman Gaya Tumulus Cluster refers to the mountain tomb cluster. In addition to Geumgwan Gaya, it is the remains of Aragaya, which represents Gaya culture. When it comes to Gaya culture, Gimhae and Goryeong are first thought of, but the Haman Malisan Tumulus Cluster is an open-air museum comparable to the tombs of Gyeongju.
