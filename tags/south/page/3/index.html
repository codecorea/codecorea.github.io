            As a child, I imagined flying freely in a big balloon like a heroine in a fairy tale. The desire to fly in the sky as an adult remains the same. It's exciting to imagine that you're flying in the wind with a hot air balloon instead of an airplane. The place to make that dream come true is Seokyung-ri village in Icheon, Gyeonggi-do. From this place, it floats up to the sky and flies around the Icheon plain, where the autumn light has fallen. Icheon, South Korea. Korea Tour
