            Tourism Tour is a new type of community-led tourism management community project where local residents become owners and voluntarily run tourism projects to create jobs and profits. In 2013, five areas including Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi-do, Yang-gu, Gangwon-do, Jecheon, Chungbuk, Cheongsong, and Jeonbuk, Buan were selected for the pilot project and supported by the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Sports.
