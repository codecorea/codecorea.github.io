            I visited Dokdo, our land that I would like to visit someday. Even on Ulleungdo, which is located about three hours from Gangneung, Ibaekri is the most easterly island on the Korean Peninsula. The appearance of keeping a seat in the middle of the sea is daunting and vague. Even if you go to the front of your nose, you can't keep your eyes on them, so you can only look at them like an unrequited love.

            There was a boy who was very curious about machines as a child. A boy who liked the radio or sewing machine in his house more than a book turned into an eco-artist when he became an adult and made great works of art using abandoned tires, LPG gas cylinders, spark plugs, bolts and nuts. This is to remind children of the importance of nature by creating a second nature from wastes produced by the destruction of nature. This is the story of Oh Dae-ho, a sculptor who created a fun park based on junk art in Boeun, Chungbuk. Junk art is an art based on the scavengers and miscellaneous things that occur in everyday life. Boeun-gun, Chungbuk, South Korea. Korea Tour

            The way people feel the change of the season is different. Scanning my body in the morning and evening, the cool breeze passing by, the warm afternoon sun, and the coffee scent of the classic cafe that feels strong today make the season change. People pass the seasonal calendar to autumn only after they feel the signs from nature with their five senses. Is the busyness of a big city blocking the fall signal and your five senses?
