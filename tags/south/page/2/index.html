            The wildflower trail that represents the metropolitan area is Mt. Cheonma, Namyangju. At 812m above sea level, various flowers bloom along the season without any burden. The route from the entrance of Supyeongsa in Hopyeong-dong to Cheolma's house and the Dolphin Spring is a section that can be called 'wild road'. White camellia and noodle trees, which cover the trail, bloom until the end of June. A lovely foot-shaped tree with purple flowers under the heart-shaped leaves tells a sad story when a mother and daughter miss her. Cheonmasan is now waiting for you with wild flowers, namely grasshoppers, moths, hawksbill flowers, wild pheasant's legs, grass swabs, true flower, dragonfly, and fin thistle. Take a slow look at the grass.There is plenty to enjoy on National Highway 45, which runs alongside the Bukhangang River. Hongyuneung, where Gojong and obedience fell asleep, is also impressive.
