            From autumn 2013 to winter, the city of Masan got attention again. It is because of the drama <Response, 1994> that sparked a big topic. The family of Najung, the owner of the boarding house, and the garbage, the main character, were all from Masan. In the drama, Masan was often mentioned, and in the meeting scene that gave a big smile, 'Masan's 3rd Gapbu' sons also appeared. As such, in the background of 1994, Masan City existed proudly. At that time, no one would have thought that Masan City would disappear. Masan was a nationwide city in the 1970s and 1980s and the best city in Gyeongnam. However, in July 2010, it was integrated with Changhae City along with Jinhae City, and now exists as Masan Membership District and Masan Happo District within Changwon City.

Only after reaching the third point of the tour of the national highway No. 2, the South Sea begins to catch up again. It is because of the castle that protruded from the west of Jinhae Bay toward the South Sea.

            The Tripitaka Koreana is considered as one of the greatest relics throughout Korea's history, or even Korea's history. Although there are about 20 species of blacksmith in the world, the eighteen thousand blacksmiths are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in June 2007 due to their high accuracy and completeness. What is so great about the eighteen thousand colonel? The place where you can see with your eyes, touch with your hands, and dig into the excellence of the blacksmith is the theme park. The entire process, from the production motives, processes, and storage of the eighteen thousand blacksmiths, can be systematically known, which not only helps children experience learning, but also allows adults to feel the mystery of the blacksmiths once again.

            In winter, a special visitor comes to the fishing of the fishermen of Geoje Island. It is a guy called ‘meetchi’ or ‘water catfish’ that climbed from the deep sea to the coast during the spawning season from December to March. It is said that the water catfish was also called the 'water term bun.' This is because when fish were caught, it was thrown into the sea, and the sound of “tumbang” sounded. It would be difficult for anyone who tasted the charm of water catfish to accept this myth. Geoje-si, Gyeongnam, Korea. Korea Tour

            In August 2013, Gyeongsangnam-do submitted a “Application for List of UNESCO World Heritage Temporary Lists” under the heading “Gimhae, Gaya Tumulus in Haman”. The Gaya Tumulus Cluster in Haman, which is trying to be registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was very unfamiliar. Although the area called Haman is an unfamiliar place as a travel destination, the Hagan Gaya Tumulus Cluster is unfamiliar. The term Haman Gaya Tumulus Cluster refers to the mountain tomb cluster. In addition to Geumgwan Gaya, it is the remains of Aragaya, which represents Gaya culture. When it comes to Gaya culture, Gimhae and Goryeong are first thought of, but the Haman Malisan Tumulus Cluster is an open-air museum comparable to the tombs of Gyeongju.

            Geojedo National Highway 14 is famous for its beautiful scenery. After passing Buksan Mountain and heading south to the sea, an impressive village appears. It is a gujo-la village that crosses the sea next to a land that looks as long as a giraffe's neck and thin like an ant's waist. There is a small mountain beyond the narrow and long town, so the impression that you want to look around is imminent. Entered the Gujo La Village as attracted by the strange charm. It's past winter, but the weather seems a bit winter, and it's too cold for spring, so it's the south side of the peninsula that shines. Jeju Island is fine, but Geoje Island is a good alternative when transportation is burdensome. It leads to Geoje Bridge, so it is easy to access and has a warm atmosphere. Beyond Geoje Bridge, you can enjoy the scenery of Namhae next to it. There are peaceful seas, islands with grains of grain, roofs gathered on the shores of fishing villages, and ships anchored in the harbor. Among them, the unique features of Geoje Island are the complex Rias coastline and the surrounding landscape. It has become monotonous with people's hands, but the coastline, which is infrequent in nature, can be seen with its intricate coastline. Take the Geoje-daero along the coastline to the east of Geoje-do, and move south to Gujo-la Village. Geoje-si, Gyeongnam, Korea. Korea Tour
