    From the 3rd of October, the “1st Gangwon Four Lakes Canoe Touring Tournament” was held for four days in Gangwon Province, which runs four major lakes (Uiam, Chuncheon, Faro, and Soyangho). This event, which canoe the hem of Chuncheon, Hwacheon, and Yanggu in Gangwon-do as a canoe, was held jointly by Gangwon-do and the Gangwon Cooperation Foundation of the Korea Tourism Organization, Chuncheon, Hwacheon, Yanggu, and Mullegil.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   The first “Gangwon-do Four Lakes Canoe Touring Tournament” was held on a tight schedule for four days. Nevertheless, I was able to successfully complete the first tournament, the protagonist “Canoe,” who swims on the water like a slippery slippery, and the ball in the lake that kept his seat silently might be big. It wasn&#39;t long, but it was enough time to know the charm of the canoe. Introducing the site of the &#39;1st Gangwon Four Lakes Canoe Touring Tournament (hereinafter referred to as the Canoe Tournament)&#39;.

   &lt;p&gt;
    On October 3, participants began to gather at the water wheel marina located in Uiam Lake in Chuncheon. More than 50 people participated, including local government officials, related industries, club members, and the general public selected from the Internet application. After a brief opening and training of canoeing by experts, I climbed a canoe and started my first day. Most of them climbed into canoes in groups of two, each with their own partner. Experts who have prepared their own canoes enjoyed canoeing alone.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   Reporter who once experienced sea kayaking from Buan Gyeokpo Port to Latitude with a small, touring kayak was confident. What is so different about &#39;paddle rowing&#39;? Kayaks and canoes were equally non-motorized, so I thought that “no” was “no” because it was paddled to light the arms.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   Even if the upper part of the boat is blocked or open, even if the kayak is large, it belongs to a canoe. The kayak must have been double-edged, but the canoe is a single day. Ohora, it should be much easier.

   &lt;p&gt;
    The point of canoeing is to &#34;take the oars that have been pushed out and bring them back horizontally to the water.&#34; I realized that most of the eco-friendly outdoor activities were “not difficult,” so I climbed a canoe with both a camera and a paddle. Iron arms, please remember the “paddling” sense of those days.

   Canoes can accommodate up to three adults or two adults (up to 13 years of age). The person who came together today is Seung-Tae Lee, manager of Canoe-related company &amp;lt;Comarine&amp;gt;. Heaven helps. Even beginners can be a pair of 2 people, but they go on a boat like this.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   Still, the course to run today is not easy. From here, you have to drive about 20.5 km from the starting point of the waterway to Hwacheon Aquatic Resort (Chuncheon Lake). Canoeing starts by climbing the canoe. One or two of the beginners get on the canoe and the boat turns over. Grab the center and moderately widen one step at a time. Luckily, there was no Buddha statue overturned.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    Usually, a coriander sits on the back of the canoe to keep pace with the front rower. Even if you paddle freely while changing your sore arm, it is entirely the “captain” that moves in my direction. The lake overlooking the canoe reveals a completely different expression than when viewed from the lake. I walk out of the Uiam Lake facing the blue thin sky. The more you canoeing, the more you get out of the noisy reality. Troubles on both shoulders spread out into the lake in a canoe.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    “Listen to the dripping sound when paddling. I canoe because of this. ”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is the sound that I want to hear first when it is time to reproduce the sound from the text someday. Infinitely quiet and peaceful waterdrops sing along the oars. At the starting point, I heard the sound before reaching the midway pier (7.5 km). You don&#39;t even have to row so that your arm hurts. Anyone, young or old, can start right away if you know how to get directions. The road that seems to be able to continue forever continues.
   &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On the afternoon of the first day, we headed from Palgakjeong to Hwacheon Aquatic Resort (13km) today. It&#39;s also fun to have a lot of canoes and snacks together on the middle water. Place the snack on the oar and deliver it to another canoe. At the end of the snack time, the boat of a participant canoe was overturned. The Aquapack was tied to a canoe, so nothing was lost, but I was unable to use my cell phone. “Wait until it is completely dry, then turn it on,” adds the advice.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;img_typeBox typeFix clfix&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In addition to canoes that can accommodate up to 3 adults, there are single canoes, which are relatively less stable. The participant in the overturned boat was transferred to the boat the reporter was on. There were experts in the front and back, so it was a consideration to take a good photo in the middle. The next day, I would like to express my gratitude to those who have joined us from the Aquatic Resort to the Yanggu Youth Training Center, which is about 22km long.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;img_typeBox typeFix clfix&#34;&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    On the second day, after moving from Aquatic Resort to Hwacheon Batter (7.4km) in the morning, I stopped at the Faro Lake Pier at the Korean Otter Research Center (8.5km) and moved to Wolmyeong Fishing Center (6km). On the first day, the whole body throbbed in the muscle pain left by canoeing, but paddling became easier. Compared to Uiamam Lake and Chuncheon Lake, the water color of the Faro Lake, which has a blue color, also contributed to its strength.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    On the third day, it traveled about 22km from Yanggu Dock to Soyang Art Farm, and on the last day, on the fourth day, it traveled a total of 11km from Soyang Art Farm to Gongjicheon Dock. As a result, the “1st Gangwon Four Lakes Canoe Touring Tournament,” which tours the four lakes of Uiam, Chuncheon, Faro, and Soyang in Gangwon-do, has ended. Those who completed a distance of more than 80km were given a brilliant “Wanter Certificate”.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    Unfortunately, the only part of the current canoe competition that can be practically experienced at this time is the Uiamam Chuncheon Waterway. It is difficult to experience in other regions except for clubs and those who enjoy canoeing personally. Don&#39;t be too sorry for that. There is a Chuncheon water wheel.

    Is there another city that goes well with Chuncheon to add the modifier of romance? Chuncheon, like the word “spring”, is a fluttering excitement that makes you unheard of. The attractions that have been loved for a long time, such as the Soyang River Dam, Uiam Lake, Cheongpyeongsa Temple, and Gongjicheon Stream, may have helped make Chuncheon a romantic city, but in fact, the calm elements hidden in various parts of Chuncheon may make Chuncheon a more romantic space. Following the well-known Chuncheon Romantic Market, a romantic alley has now appeared.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;strong class=&#34;ar_title&#34;&gt;
   Alleyway warmth, art and culture excitement
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   Is there another space full of emotion and full of personality like an alleyway? Every road in the world has its own story, but here in Chuncheon Hyoja&#39;s alleyway boasts a unique story and personality. Hyoja Village Romantic Alley. I&#39;m just curious about the name, and I have a desire to walk around. Hyoja residents and local artists worked together to improve the village environment under the name of the “Romantic Alley Project,” which transforms Chuncheon&#39;s deteriorated village into a space filled with art and culture. Thus, Romantic Alley Project No. 1, Hyoja Village Romantic Alley was born.
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   At the beginning of the narrow alley, there are works by young men with wild ginseng and baby tigers. The title of the work is ‘Ban Hee-an and the Little Tiger’. Ban Hee-an is a figure related to the birth of Hyoja Village. In the middle of Joseon Dynasty, Hyoja Ban Hee-an took care of a seriously ill mother with utmost care. One day, when a mountain god appeared in a dream and went to Daeryongsan, there were three corpses. Among them, the throat of the corpse was cut and orphaned and presented to the mother. Ban Hee-an followed what the Sanshin ordered. When I opened the lid of the pot to give my mother medicine, there was wild ginseng instead of the body&#39;s head. So Nomo saved his life. In the winter that year, when Nomo suddenly wanted to eat strawberries, he went to the mountain to get strawberries again. At the end of the twist, he rescued a strawberry, but was lost in a blizzard and met a tiger. But instead of harming Ban Hee-an, the tiger drove him home and disappeared. In 41 years of the Joseon Dynasty, the Hyoja purification was given to praise the filial piety of Ban Hee-an. Later, as the Hyojamun was erected at the entrance of the village, it was called Hyojamun Street and got the name Hyoja. &#39;Ban Hee-an and the Little Tiger&#39; is a work that explains the origin of Hyoja.
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   Let&#39;s take a look at this work and understand the neighborhood called Hyoja and then go into the alley. You can see a shop called &#39;Green Mart&#39; at the entrance of the alley. The neighborhood shop, which is gradually disappearing due to the convenience store, saves the alley. You can buy a drink or sit on the floor in front of the store and take a break. A tiger with a humorous expression greets the wall just opposite Green Mart. A mural with harmonious landscapes of Hyo-ja and characters of the Zodiac, including a tiger, is painted on a cement wall that would have been dry, giving a cozy and pleasant feeling. The title of this work is &#39;The Way to Hyoja Award&#39;. In order to welcome the visitors and wish to be a Hyoja village filled with love flowers, laughter flowers, and happy songs, we depicted tigers and zodiac animals guarding the village. When you enter the alley along the wall, there is a 3D romantic photo zone under the sign “Dongil Petroleum”. If you take a picture here, you can produce it with the feeling of entering Hyojamun.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   The secret azit hidden in the romantic alley, the small library
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   Along the way, you will see a playground and a modern, modern building that doesn&#39;t match the local atmosphere. It is the Children&#39;s Library “Damjak Small Library” (033-256-6363). It is a structure that takes off the shoes on the 3rd floor, so it is a comfortable atmosphere like my home. Daljak Library, which opened in 2008, is special in that it is not a bustling city but a culturally marginalized and old small town. Maybe it&#39;s because of the neighborhood atmosphere. Damjak Library is more comfortable and warm than any other place.
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   From the 1st floor space to the 3rd floor for infants and toddlers, choose a book you like anywhere and sit there. It is a place where you can lean on the wall, lie down, and become friends with books as if you were at home. It is far from any library with a hard atmosphere. Because parents are comfortable and children are comfortable, families often come together. There is also a cafe on the first floor. Café latte, cappuccino, iced tea and other breads are all 1,000 won, so there is no burden. There are also books for adults to see in this space, so it&#39;s good to drink a cup of tea with your children and fall in love with reading.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   A neighborhood alley full of interesting things
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When you come out of the library and go up the right path, you can see the mood of an alleyway with small wooden chairs and a box of fruit trees underneath the stone wall. &#39;Tell me your wishes&#39;, etc. are implemented. It is lovely to see the stones on the mossy wall wearing colorful clothes one by one, and the animals hiding there are pretty. I can feel the warmth from the grandmothers in the neighborhood sitting on the alleys and chatting and the children running around. It is not a dead alley, but a living alley. You can see works along this alley and at the end of the alley you can see the city of Chuncheon through the roofs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   Let&#39;s go down to the place where the mural called &#39;The Way to Hyojasang&#39; was located again. This time, do not bend in the 3D romantic photo zone, but go straight up. On this road, ‘Skykeeper Junk Robot’ or taekwon V made of wood, which uses waste electrical appliances, appears. When you go up the hill with Taekwon V, you can see the sperm where you can rest for a while. If you sit in the pavilion for a while, the loud noises of the grandmother and grandfather come out from the Hyoja Moon Path Hall opposite. Unlike other senior citizens, it is noticeable that grandmothers and grandfathers hang handmade items. This is where the romantic alley is different from the mural villages in other regions.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   The Romantic Alley Project is part of the project to create a living and cultural community. Rather than just putting out veneer with murals or artworks, work is underway to restore the community like a rural village as residents of Hyoja 1-dong interact with each other. Opening a course for residents, such as ceramics and reform, and creating a cafe where people can communicate, provides opportunities for residents to greet each other and get to know each other. This year, regardless of academic background, residents of Hyoja 1-dong started &#39;Hyoja Village University&#39;, where they become dean, professor, and student. If you look at the flesh as well as the appearance, you will realize the charm of Hyoja Village Romantic Alley.

   Chuncheon Romantic Walk to the Romantic Market
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   If it&#39;s too bad to end with a romantic alley, then take a walk to the romantic market. Walk down from the romantic alley to ‘Festival Theater Gesture’ and walk along the Yaksa Pass Pass to see the Chuncheon Romantic Market (Central Market). The central market, one of Chuncheon&#39;s representative traditional markets, was transformed into a new space where culture, art, and relaxation blended with the concept of a simple market in 2010 following the cultural tourism market development project. Beautiful murals were painted all over the market, and signboards were also transformed into distinctive features. Changes also took place in the old and old market alleys. In some alleys, the warmth and memories of the old market appear, and in some alleys, minicars run through the old wires on the wall.
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   Others such as the &#39;Romantic Salon&#39;, which acts as an information center for the romantic market, the &#39;Romantic Chamber&#39; showing the history of the central market, the &#39;Space Odong&#39; where you can see the work of local artists, and a market lounge where guests and merchants can rest. There are many exotic spaces that cannot be found on the market. In the romantic market, the fun of visiting and buying things adds to the fun of finding cultural art works and spaces hidden around the market. If you run from market to market, from alley to alley, you&#39;ll get a few bags of romance.
  &lt;/div&gt;
