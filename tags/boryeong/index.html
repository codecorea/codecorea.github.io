            There is a saying that all roads in the northern Boryeong area connect with Ocheon. This is because the port of Ocheon served as the main port and military port of Boryeong in the Baekje period. Since then, Ocheon Port has become a small fishing port, but recently it has been regaining its old glory due to the clamshell. Ocheon Port occupies about 60% of the country's production, and gourmets from all over the country gather at the port. Azalea blooming is the key season in April. Boryeong, Chungnam, Korea.

            Autumn has come silently, but the ripe autumn leaves still have to wait. As I wait for the autumn leaves, I go to a place where I'm impatient or the autumn breeze is overwhelming. It is a silver grass colony of Oseo Mountain in Boryeong, Chungnam. The sunset over the silver grass, the golden field and the glow of the west coast are bonuses. I loaded my body on a train on the Janghang Line and walked into the autumn. Boryeong, Chungnam, Korea. Korea Tour

Autumn is in full swing as you look at the colorful leaves colored in the air. And looking at the carpeted land where falling rain drops fall, we feel that autumn is about to leave.
