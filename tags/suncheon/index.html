            The Suncheon Bay International Garden Expo will be held until October 20th in Suncheon, a beautiful and prosperous island. As its name suggests, it is an eco-friendly ecological exhibition that presents gardens and cultures from around the world in Suncheon Bay. To be easy to solve'Feast of Flowers Blooming on the Suncheon Bay Stage'Maybe not. I am curious in this passage. Why Suncheon Bay? First, let's start with the location of Suncheon Bay. Boseong Beolgyo in the west and Gwangyang in the east, and Suncheon, located between them, directly touch the South Sea. Thanks to the Goheung Peninsula below Boseong and the Yeosu Peninsula below Gwangyang, Suncheon has “Suncheon Bay” on both sides. Suncheon, which has both Goheung and Gobaekho Gwangyang on the left, gained only the Namhae and Suncheon bays that are stable to look at. At the end of Namdo Island, Suncheon also has fresh water stems that touch the sea. The streams of the valley gathered to form a river, and the rivers continued to go out to sea. In the space where fresh water meets salty water, where the two are mixed, more diverse stories are born. Only Suncheon belongs here. Suncheon, Jeonnam, Korea. Korea Tour
