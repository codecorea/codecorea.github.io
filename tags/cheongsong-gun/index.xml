    The weather has become quite cold. In winter, the scenery that snows first comes to mind, but many travelers remember the night in a house with a warm lower neck. Gyeongsangbuk-do has many old houses, and it is also a place where you can experience Hanok, as it is the hometown of the Yangban. How about finding a house in Gyeongbuk this winter and spending a long winter night in a warm lower neck?
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   Seongcheon, Cheongsong, the smallest courtyard in the world
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Cheongsong is a town with beautiful Juwangsan in all seasons. On the road from Cheongsong-eup to Juwangsan, there is an old mansion called Seongcheondaek in a village called Cheongdong. There is a record that a man named Chun-Seop Lim, who had served as a leader in the Gojong Dynasty in Gojong, Chosun, bought this house. It is said that the house was built about 300 years ago.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   Seongcheon-daek is designated as Important Folk Cultural Property No. 172 under the name Cheong-dong Seongcheon-daek. Seongcheon&#39;s house is the grandmother&#39;s house of residence when the old house was designated as a cultural property. When she was 16 years old, she got married and lived over 90 years old. She said she had kept her home alone after she left her husband.
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   Seongcheon&#39;s house is a typical courtyard in Gyeongsangbuk-do. The yard house is a ‘ㅁ’ shaped house with a yard in the center. It is a small space with 5 spaces on the front and 4 spaces on the side. Gangwon-do and Gyeongbuk mountainous areas were cold in winter, and there was always a threat of predation, so you had to put everything in your house. Seongcheon&#39;s charm is the yard. Perhaps there is no such small courtyard in the world. Making a yard in the middle of a well-compressed house… . Moreover, the sky is as small as the yard through the roof. It is the only space where the yard communicates with the world. Seongcheon&#39;s house has a small but overall texture, and it feels like a stiff feeling.
  &lt;/div&gt;

   Seongcheon&#39;s house consisted of Anchae and Sarangchae. Anchae and Sarangchae each have two rooms. Sarangchae is divided into sliding doors, and Anchae is divided into a back room and a large room.

   Sumol Village, the sublimation of the Art Village, and Jirye Art Village in Andong
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In 1990, the construction of the Imha Dam drowned Jirye Village. Jirye Village was a historic village with a history of over 300 years with the incense of Kim Bang-geol, the chief of the South Koreans during the reign of King Sukjong. Due to the dam construction, the village disappeared entirely, and only some of the old houses were moved to the mountainside overlooking the old village. It is Jirye Art Village. Jichon Jongtaek, Jichon Jecheong, and Jisan Seodang were designated as cultural properties in 1985, and were subsequently transferred to the mountain valley behind the village. There is a special story here. Before the village was sunk, novelist Kim Yong-ik, the author of The Flower God, visited the village, and when he heard that it was about to be sunk, he told an American artist village story. An art village is a group residence where artists who perform literature, art, and music can stay for a long time and concentrate on art activities. With the proposal of Kim Yong-ik, Jichon Jongtaek and its affiliated buildings were relocated to Jirye Arts Village.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The Jirye Art Village wasn&#39;t on the road until 2011 until the road was paved. From the 34th road from Andong to Cheongsong, after passing through Suaedang, you have to go through a winding road of 11km to reach Jirye Art Village. There is also an anecdote that a couple of French ambassadors misunderstood it as a kidnapping when a road leads to the middle of the mountain on a steep mountain road. However, since they are in the outback, not only the artists who do creative activities, but also those who want to rest quietly in the beautiful scenery are always on the move.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    Jirye Art Village has 17 guest rooms including Jichon Jongtaek, Jisan Seodang, and Jeonggok Auditorium. Artists can stay for a long time, so the feel of the artist village is felt. Byeolmyo, located in front of Jichon Jongtaek, has the best view from Jirye Art Village. The beautiful scenery around Im Ha-ho, like the phrase “I see the blue mountains all day long without words” at the end of the poem &amp;lt;Mute&amp;gt;, by the poet Kim Bang-geul of the village, is enough. Gotaek Experience is the homepage of Jirye Art Village (

   Hometown of 《Food Dimibang》, Nutrition Byeongam House
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;txt_p&#34;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Yeongyang-gun Doodle Village is a hometown of Jae-ryeong Lee, whose name is Seok-myeong Lee&#39;s teacher. It is also the hometown of ‘Food Dimebang,’ written by Andong Jang, the government, and novelist Lee Moon-yeol.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Doodle Village Byeongam House was built in 1868 by a man named Lee-Byung, and is said to have been bought by the father of the current resident Lee Byeong-Tae in the 1950s. Along with Byeongam Mountain, a rocky mountain that stands like a folding screen across Hwamaecheon, a tag called &#39;Byeongam&#39; was added to the old house.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    There are many rooms in Byeongam House, but it is unique to have 10 gongs. It is said that it was a big problem in the winter months because there were a lot of puffs because the spheres were all over. Byeongam House has no main gate. This is because one of the dirt walls surrounding the old house was opened. In fact, it is said that the gate was not even when the old house was built. Perhaps it was a way to accept nature in the house. Hwamaecheon and Byeongamsan mountain streams, which are covered with trees and run down the hill, are hard to see.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    If you open the door of the Byeongam House in the shape of ‘ㅁ’ and enter the main building, you can see the wide courtyard and Daecheongmaru. Byeongam House is the highest in Daecheong in Doodle Village. Since the old house is quite large, the open sky is clear between the ‘ㅁ’ roofs. The main room and the back room continue to the left and right of the Daecheong, and the kitchen and a small love room continue below. Below the back room are Gobang, Jungbang, and Sarangchae with an attic. In Byeongam House, you can experience the house in Anchae, Sarangchae, and Haengrangchae. In addition to the Byeongam House, you can also experience the house at Seokgye House, Baekcheon Hanok, Inspiration House, and Lee Won-bak House.
