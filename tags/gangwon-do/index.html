It was called “Untan Road,” which was carrying coal during the booming period of coal, and it was also called “flower arthropod” because it hungered wild flowers such as rhododendrons when they were hungry and soothed their hunger. Another name, 'Hwajeolryeong', is a Chinese character name for 'flower fold'. The flowers bloom beautifully in Hwajeolryeong 'flower arrangement' today. Jeongseon-gun, Gangwon-do, Korea. Korea Tour

            Deep in the heart, it is a eager spring. Spring meets Goseong, Gangwon-do, and the taste is different. National highway No. 7 along the sea is also in contact with the road to deliver the 'spring of the era' gift. At the end of February, families of separated families traveled along this path to open a spring of sea ice mood. It was the way to reunion in 3 years and 4 months. Hwajinpo, Geojin, Jajin, Machajin, Daejin, and other high-end muzzles and lakes have also become a charming way for spring.Goseong's March is still cold. The snowfall remains on the rugged mountainside beyond the representative attraction of Hwajinpo Lake. Still, a warm air blows between the traveler's footsteps and the seafarer's material. Just as the sea ice mood was held after the big and small accidents, spring energy began in the cold and trials. The spring that meets Goseong's port and lake is a wish and a wish.

            Gangwon-do, where freshness goes and the clouds rest. At the end of last winter, too many snow clouds were resting. The ever-falling snow became a natural disaster, causing great damage to Gangwon-do. In 2005, a wildfire that came over in a strong wind hit Naksansa Temple. Ironically, it was Arbor Day on April 5. The forest fires caused Naksansa to be close to the battlefield. I couldn't help but be sorry for the sight of the burning of the cylinder and the melting of the same Joseon dynasty designated as a treasure. Naksansa Temple, which has risen again due to unfaithfulness, is still a sanctuary of seawater Kannon. Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do, Korea. Korea Tour

            Corianders say. About ‘the taste of winter travel’. We, afraid of cold wind and cold, turn on the TV in the warm lower neck. This is because you can enjoy the winter scenery while watching KBS <Day 1, 2 Days>, which reached Season 3, and MBC's <Daddy, Where>, where you can see the cute little kids' growth. Sometimes I think of 'I'll go once' while watching delicious food or a great winter scenery. So I looked. Where are their favorite winter destinations? Inje-gun, Gangwon-do, Korea. Korea Tour

If you want to soothe your desire to live in Saldun, you can stay at a campsite or pension run by Saldun Village, and spending a night in a private home is a pretty good way.

            This summer, which was unusually hot, swept across the country, but only some mountainous areas in Gangwon-do, such as Daegwallyeong, were excluded from the heat wave. The temperature fell like a lie when I arrived at Daegwallyeong on the highway in the heat of over 30 degrees. The wind was cool and the air was clear. In the evening, I had to take out long clothes, and on some days, the temperature dropped below 20 degrees. It's not an exaggeration to say that I have been to the sea and the valley, but there is no summer resort like Daegwallyeong.
