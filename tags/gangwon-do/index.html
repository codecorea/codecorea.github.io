            There are two ways to enjoy winter. One is to find a warm indoor fun to avoid the cold, and the other is to experience the best of winter with the whole body. The latter example is Hwacheon Mountain Trout Festival. At Hwacheon Mountain Trout Festival, ice fishing, ice sledding, ice football, ice bicycle, skating, and other winter games were gathered. All the fun in winter can be enjoyed. Even if it is not explained with the title of “World Four Winter Festival” and “7 Wonders of World Winter,” it has become a representative winter festival in Korea. The reason why more than 1 million people visit the Hwacheon Mountain Trout Festival each year is 'being fun and fun'. Hwacheon-gun, Gangwon-do, Korea. Korea Tour

            The Hwacheon Sancheon Fish Festival, which has been selected as the representative festival of the Republic of Korea for four consecutive years, announced its opening on the 14th. Thanks to the powerful cold weather that had been visited two or three days ago, Hwacheoncheon was not frozen. More than 200,000 tourists went to the first weekend. They faced the wind and heated up fishing for trout. The best part of the Mountain Trout Festival is silk fishing. From zip wires to ice sleds, you won't have 24 hours a day to chill out. Let's go to the winter kingdom Hwacheon to fully enjoy this winter. Hwacheon-gun, Gangwon-do, Korea. Korea Tour
