            Children play well with sand or even a few branches. When a child sits on the ground or crawls after an ant, the parents become furious. I hate to get my clothes dirty, and I wonder if the germs may move. So, these days, kids spend time inside their homes, or at best, play in kids cafes and indoor playgrounds. It is the wish of every parent that a child grows up healthy. If you want your body and mind to be healthy and grow up in nature, you need to let them play in nature, not artificial amusement facilities. Children make play by using all kinds of creative methods even with simple natural objects. Stepping on the soil, smelling wild flowers, and playing in the woods, where you can feel the warmth of the trees, is close by. Geumcheon-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour

            It's fun to see the market even if there is no specific use. Fun to choose a variety of things, to taste a variety of food, and to see people. There is no end to the market views that have a lot of fun. Today, we are going to focus on ‘flavor’, which belongs to the ‘big fun’ of overflowing fun. As it is a representative market in Seoul, a variety of foods overflow. Introducing the more interesting Namdaemun & Dongdaemun taste tour than the market. Let's take a look at Namdaemun Market.

            There is a way to enjoy a book while walking outside the stuffy interior. It refers to 'Gyeongui Seonseo Street', which is a book-themed theme around Hongik University Station, renowned for its music, art and youth. It's a good way to sit on a bench and read a book on the upcoming spring day. This is a road where you can enter the booth installed at the Gyeongui Precinct Street and enjoy the good luck of sharing your eyes with the artist you stumbled upon while reading a book.

            Jingwansa is a mother-like temple. It is near, so you can visit it often, and the temple that you embraced under the mountain of Bukhansan is also comfortable. In Jingwansa Temple, there is no monk's stern bamboo scolding his heart. Instead, there are garden-like temples, delicious and healthy temple foods like rice cooked by mothers, and programs to chat and learn while sipping tea with a graceful monk. It does not force the obsession of 'empty your heart' or 'find me'. Just as you came to your mother in your hometown, you can walk slowly through the temple like the back of my house.

            There are many ways to enjoy a 500-year history tour of Joseon in Seoul. Perhaps one of the first hands is the palace where the king of Joseon Dynasty stayed. The four main palaces in the Joseon Dynasty that remain in Seoul are Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace, and Deoksugung Palace. They open the night landscape under the name of night viewing. Jongno, Daehak-ro, and Gwanghwamun walk through the downtown of Seoul, and the night view of the palace that passed by is very popular. That's because it closes as soon as you start buying tickets every night. If you missed this special tour, take a look at the day and night scenery of the palace and try your next special tour. Clearly, it is our proud history that is unfortunate and unfortunate to see only at night. Jongno-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour
