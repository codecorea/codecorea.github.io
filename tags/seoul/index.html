            There are shops that are returning with hundreds or thousands of SNS certification shots. The price seems a bit high, but the attractive idea that satisfies everything including taste, space, atmosphere and mood deserves to slip away from your pocket. The quality of the product is nagging. After seeing the exterior, opening the door, sitting and watching the fun, he turns his head, and as soon as the food comes into the mouth, the admiration gun is fired.

            In fact, 'taste' has nothing to do with the season. Didn't find hot food in the summer because of the heat. The same is true for winter. The cold noodles called 'cool noodles' were a winter delicacy in the north of Korea. Nevertheless, there is a ‘taste’ that crosses the season. The hot taste of the tip of the nose, the whole body getting hot, and the drops of sweat springing up one by one. Here's a spicy taste that will blow you away from the stress that comes up behind your neck even when you're in tears. Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour

            The journey begins with daily life. It is because you feel inspiration from the moment you see something familiar, and it is identified with the excitement you experience in an unfamiliar destination. For example, Yongsan Printing Industrial Complex, which goes by way of work, and the national office that stops on the way home. It's so common that you just listen to the extraordinary things that are hidden in them. Maybe this is the best place to forget the cold wind this winter. Korea, Seoul. Korea Tour
