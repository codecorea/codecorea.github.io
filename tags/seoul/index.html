            Dessert, is there something sweeter and more tempting than this? A bitter black coffee and a dessert that was born in a natural way began to make a refreshing transformation with a beer and a meal instead of a meal. The five desserts I found on Itaewon's alleys are as delicious and lovely as the exotic. The power of a piece of dessert that blows away everyday stress in one room!

            Seochon Village, the nickname for the western village of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Let's take a look at the map before starting a full-scale Seochon village tour. If you want to know where Seochon really refers to, I would recommend a map of the Seoul Castle that was introduced around Inwangsan (338m), Bukaksan (342m), Naksan (125m), and Namsan (262m). Now, the meaning has faded, but the boundary that separates 'inside and out of the city of Hanyang' is this Seoul Castle. Just as modern people in the 21st century want to live in Gangnam, at that time their ancestors probably didn't want to live in the 'Sadaeseongmun'. Jongno-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour
