            How is the weather in Korea this summer? Let's take a look at the three-month forecast from the Korea Meteorological Administration from June to August 2013. “The summer temperature will be higher than the average, and the precipitation will be similar to the average. 9 to 11 typhoons will occur, and 1 to 2 will affect Korea. ” If you look at this in detail by month, “There will be many cloudy days under the influence of low pressure in July and many hot days under August under the influence of high pressure in the North Pacific.” Families interested in weather forecasting and meteorological phenomena should visit the Korea Meteorological Administration and enjoy experiential learning. Like a weather forecaster, you can draw a weather map based on the air pressure layout and stand in front of a TV camera to become a weather caster that delivers weather news.

            Children play well with sand or even a few branches. When a child sits on the ground or crawls after an ant, the parents become furious. I hate to get my clothes dirty, and I wonder if the germs may move. So, these days, kids spend time inside their homes, or at best, play in kids cafes and indoor playgrounds. It is the wish of every parent that a child grows up healthy. If you want your body and mind to be healthy and grow up in nature, you need to let them play in nature, not artificial amusement facilities. Children make play by using all kinds of creative methods even with simple natural objects. Stepping on the soil, smelling wild flowers, and playing in the woods, where you can feel the warmth of the trees, is close by. Geumcheon-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour
