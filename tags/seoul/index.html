            Jingwansa is a mother-like temple. It is near, so you can visit it often, and the temple that you embraced under the mountain of Bukhansan is also comfortable. In Jingwansa Temple, there is no monk's stern bamboo scolding his heart. Instead, there are garden-like temples, delicious and healthy temple foods like rice cooked by mothers, and programs to chat and learn while sipping tea with a graceful monk. It does not force the obsession of 'empty your heart' or 'find me'. Just as you came to your mother in your hometown, you can walk slowly through the temple like the back of my house.

The blood-sharing war between the Korean people continued with the casualties of the United States, the Soviet Union, and China until the July 1953 armistice.

            There are many ways to enjoy a 500-year history tour of Joseon in Seoul. Perhaps one of the first hands is the palace where the king of Joseon Dynasty stayed. The four main palaces in the Joseon Dynasty that remain in Seoul are Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace, and Deoksugung Palace. They open the night landscape under the name of night viewing. Jongno, Daehak-ro, and Gwanghwamun walk through the downtown of Seoul, and the night view of the palace that passed by is very popular. That's because it closes as soon as you start buying tickets every night. If you missed this special tour, take a look at the day and night scenery of the palace and try your next special tour. Clearly, it is our proud history that is unfortunate and unfortunate to see only at night. Jongno-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour

            In fact, 'taste' has nothing to do with the season. Didn't find hot food in the summer because of the heat. The same is true for winter. The cold noodles called 'cool noodles' were a winter delicacy in the north of Korea. Nevertheless, there is a ‘taste’ that crosses the season. The hot taste of the tip of the nose, the whole body getting hot, and the drops of sweat springing up one by one.
