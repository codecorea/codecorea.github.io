            I thought it was best to see the sunrise rise sharply above the sharp horizon. I really believed so. Well, I met a nice sunrise where I didn't really expect.

            The journey begins with daily life. It is because you feel inspiration from the moment you see something familiar, and it is identified with the excitement you experience in an unfamiliar destination. For example, Yongsan Printing Industrial Complex, which goes by way of work, and the national office that stops on the way home. It's so common that you just listen to the extraordinary things that are hidden in them. Maybe this is the best place to forget the cold wind this winter. Korea, Seoul. Korea Tour

            I think of traveling far away. However, it is urban travel that is becoming a new trend of travel for modern people who can hardly find a trip. Among them, a trip to an alleyway centered on a particular street brings new pleasures. Bangbae-dong in Seoul reminds us of a cafe alley, but there is a new way.
