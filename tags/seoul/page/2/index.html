            Uiyeong-gil in Bukhansan is a good way for the whole family to walk together. It is a mountain path, but the road is wide so you can walk with your shoulders. There are no steep or steep sections, so children walk well. In the autumn and solstice, the scent of the forest scents, and when you walk on Uyi-Ring, laughter blooms in your family's face.

Hongdae & Sinchon, a street where young people live in diverse cultures, Jongno & Insa-dong where temple restaurants are gathered, and Detox juice and salad specialty shops.

            I think of traveling far away. However, it is urban travel that is becoming a new trend of travel for modern people who can hardly find a trip. Among them, a trip to an alleyway centered on a particular street brings new pleasures. Bangbae-dong in Seoul reminds us of a cafe alley, but there is a new way. Let's take a trip to fall with the 'Bangbae-dong Sai-gil', which is frequented up and down recently. Seocho-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour

            As spring approaches, we have a date course where you can take a gentle walk and a cup of hot coffee. When we say 'mountain', we often think of 'Hasanju', but if it's the same time as the spring breeze is blowing, wouldn't it be better to add 'tea' instead of 'sake'? I left the early spring outing with a walk and a cup of tea at Suaksan Mountain located in Uijeongbu and Nowon-gu, Gyeonggi-do.

Located between Sanggye-dong, Nowon-gu, Seoul, and Uijeongbu-si, Gyeonggi-do, Suraksan (638m) is a mountain that is beloved by citizens along with Bukhansan, Dobongsan, and Bulamsan. The seemingly muscular rock walls may make hiking a burden, but pickling is not so harsh. Professional mountaineers can enjoy hiking in the mountains of Bulam ~ Suraksan ~ Dobongsan ~ Bukhansan, but it is enough to enjoy one by one. Nowon-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour
