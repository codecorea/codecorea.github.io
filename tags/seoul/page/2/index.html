            It is the 'President of Minui', but it is the place where the ordinary people cannot easily access. However, it is easy for anyone to visit and visit here if they want. However, if you make a reservation 3 days before the tour. A place that will be a good experience for adults as well as children's performance evaluation. In addition, it is closely related to the contents of the textbook, so in many ways it is worth calling it “the number one elementary field trip”. Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour

            Children play well with sand or even a few branches. When a child sits on the ground or crawls after an ant, the parents become furious. I hate to get my clothes dirty, and I wonder if the germs may move. So, these days, kids spend time inside their homes, or at best, play in kids cafes and indoor playgrounds. It is the wish of every parent that a child grows up healthy. If you want your body and mind to be healthy and grow up in nature, you need to let them play in nature, not artificial amusement facilities. Children make play by using all kinds of creative methods even with simple natural objects. Stepping on the soil, smelling wild flowers, and playing in the woods, where you can feel the warmth of the trees, is close by. Geumcheon-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour

            It's fun to see the market even if there is no specific use. Fun to choose a variety of things, to taste a variety of food, and to see people. There is no end to the market views that have a lot of fun. Today, we are going to focus on ‘flavor’, which belongs to the ‘big fun’ of overflowing fun. As it is a representative market in Seoul, a variety of foods overflow. Introducing the more interesting Namdaemun & Dongdaemun taste tour than the market. Let's take a look at Namdaemun Market.

            There is a way to enjoy a book while walking outside the stuffy interior. It refers to 'Gyeongui Seonseo Street', which is a book-themed theme around Hongik University Station, renowned for its music, art and youth. It's a good way to sit on a bench and read a book on the upcoming spring day. This is a road where you can enter the booth installed at the Gyeongui Precinct Street and enjoy the good luck of sharing your eyes with the artist you stumbled upon while reading a book.
