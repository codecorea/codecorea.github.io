            Travelers who know the charm of traditional markets take a tour of the local traditional market as an essential course. This is because it is fun to walk around and watch around with the freedom of the stranger and to visit restaurants that have kept a place for a long time. Chungcheongbuk-do Cheongju Land Market is a market with many things to see and eat to be included in the top 10 tours of Cheongju. There is a Mushimcheondo six-way street market that runs through the city of Cheongju, so it seems like you are dancing. Cheongju, Chungbuk, Korea. Korea Tour

            It seems that the temple is sitting on the middle of the cliff. When I was standing in the temple courtyard, the sea of the mountain line spread out under the snow fell. The overlapping mountain trunks resemble waves coming from far away. The Cheongpung Lake, held in its arms, is as calm as a sanctuary. The human mind also crossed rage and tranquility, and the scenery and mind resembled it. If you go to Jeongbangsa, you can see the scenery that resembles your heart. Jecheon-si, Chungbuk, Korea.

            There was a boy who was very curious about machines as a child. A boy who liked the radio or sewing machine in his house more than a book turned into an eco-artist when he became an adult and made great works of art using abandoned tires, LPG gas cylinders, spark plugs, bolts and nuts. This is to remind children of the importance of nature by creating a second nature from wastes produced by the destruction of nature. This is the story of Oh Dae-ho, a sculptor who created a fun park based on junk art in Boeun, Chungbuk. Junk art is an art based on the scavengers and miscellaneous things that occur in everyday life. Boeun-gun, Chungbuk, South Korea. Korea Tour

            The phrase 'Cheongpungho Jadrakgil' is very pretty. It's also soft to pronounce, and it feels like ‘Sabujakjidada’, meaning that it acts lightly and effortlessly. I feel that it will be a trekking course that is easy to walk for some reason. Jadrak-gil refers to ‘a narrow path in a hilly country at the foot of a mountain.’ The name Cheongpungho is in front of it because the road runs around the mountain village surrounding Cheongpungho. It is a hiking trail, but it is difficult to walk. Of the 100 ridges in Cheongpungho in Jecheon, it is difficult to find a walking trail with such a great view point, as you walk along the beautiful scenery around the lake.

            Each city must have one or two markets to offer. So, when you travel to each city, you can't miss the fun of going around the traditional market. Another market is waiting for Chungju. Free market, Muhak market, public market, Chungui market, and Pungmul market are gathered in one place along Chungju stream. The fact that several markets are gathered in one place is one of the biggest characteristics of Chungju traditional markets.
