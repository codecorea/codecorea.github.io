            There is a saying in our proverb, 'I heard it in my pocket.' It looks like a shabby bag, but it contains confidential documents. It is a metaphor that people or things seem shabby and ugly on the outside, but in reality, they have extraordinary values and excellent qualities. This is exactly the lava temple in Okcheon, North Chungcheong Province. The shape of the temple is plain. However, the magnificent sunrise spreading over the mountain peaks surrounded by dark clouds in the early morning is an unparalleled scenery.

            It seems that the temple is sitting on the middle of the cliff. When I was standing in the temple courtyard, the sea of the mountain line spread out under the snow fell. The overlapping mountain trunks resemble waves coming from far away. The Cheongpung Lake, held in its arms, is as calm as a sanctuary. The human mind also crossed rage and tranquility, and the scenery and mind resembled it. If you go to Jeongbangsa, you can see the scenery that resembles your heart. Jecheon-si, Chungbuk, Korea.

            There was a boy who was very curious about machines as a child. A boy who liked the radio or sewing machine in his house more than a book turned into an eco-artist when he became an adult and made great works of art using abandoned tires, LPG gas cylinders, spark plugs, bolts and nuts. This is to remind children of the importance of nature by creating a second nature from wastes produced by the destruction of nature. This is the story of Oh Dae-ho, a sculptor who created a fun park based on junk art in Boeun, Chungbuk.

            The phrase 'Cheongpungho Jadrakgil' is very pretty. It's also soft to pronounce, and it feels like ‘Sabujakjidada’, meaning that it acts lightly and effortlessly. I feel that it will be a trekking course that is easy to walk for some reason. Jadrak-gil refers to ‘a narrow path in a hilly country at the foot of a mountain.’ The name Cheongpungho is in front of it because the road runs around the mountain village surrounding Cheongpungho. It is a hiking trail, but it is difficult to walk. Of the 100 ridges in Cheongpungho in Jecheon, it is difficult to find a walking trail with such a great view point, as you walk along the beautiful scenery around the lake.
