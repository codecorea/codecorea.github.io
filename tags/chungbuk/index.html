            Each city must have one or two markets to offer. So, when you travel to each city, you can't miss the fun of going around the traditional market. Another market is waiting for Chungju. Free market, Muhak market, public market, Chungui market, and Pungmul market are gathered in one place along Chungju stream. The fact that several markets are gathered in one place is one of the biggest characteristics of Chungju traditional markets. It's like a huge market, but five different markets work together to bring you special fun. Chungju, Chungbuk, Korea. Korea Tour

            Terms that describe good restaurants such as model restaurants, local restaurants, recommended restaurants, Daemulim restaurants, food restaurants, top restaurants, and TV broadcast restaurants vary by region. The expression I stumbled across the city of Chungju a while ago in Chungju was 'Good Rice House'. Chungcheongbuk-do has been implemented since 2013.
