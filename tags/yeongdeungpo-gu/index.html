            It is the 'President of Minui', but it is the place where the ordinary people cannot easily access. However, it is easy for anyone to visit and visit here if they want. However, if you make a reservation 3 days before the tour. A place that will be a good experience for adults as well as children's performance evaluation. In addition, it is closely related to the contents of the textbook, so in many ways it is worth calling it “the number one elementary field trip”. Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour

            There are a lot of buildings and apartments when you walk around the Han River and look around. Excluding the ridges of Mt. I hope that the Bukhansan Mountain is not covered by the building. When you escape from the Han River, the scenery of the low world, which was hidden in the big building, unfolds. The sidewalk block is stuck like a ruler and the square sign is dizzy. Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour

            If you walk around Daelim Central Market in Daelim 2-dong, Yeongdeungpo-gu, you will experience illiteracy unintentionally. Eight percent of the language you see and hear is Chinese. It is a place where the lives of Chinese people can be seen as if they were thought of as Korean villages in China, not Chinese villages in Korea. Let's meet a variety of different foods that Chinese people enjoy everyday in a Chinese village located in Daelim 2-dong. Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour

            In fact, 'taste' has nothing to do with the season. Didn't find hot food in the summer because of the heat. The same is true for winter. The cold noodles called 'cool noodles' were a winter delicacy in the north of Korea. Nevertheless, there is a ‘taste’ that crosses the season. The hot taste of the tip of the nose, the whole body getting hot, and the drops of sweat springing up one by one. Here's a spicy taste that will blow you away from the stress that comes up behind your neck even when you're in tears. Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour
