  <div class="txt_p">
   The National Gwangju Science Museum opened in October 2013 under the theme of 'light' and 'art', the symbols of Gwangju. Children are especially fond of the hands-on exhibitions, which are directly manipulated and touched. It is exciting for middle and high school students as well as adults. The 1st and 2nd exhibition halls are located on the 2nd floor, and the children's hall for children and the 4D theater are on the 1st floor. It is better to go up to the 2nd floor after checking the 4D theater time in advance.

   1 The exhibition hall is about light and art. How would you respond if your child asks, "Mom, why does the shadow keep following me?" The answer, "If there is light, a shadow is cast." Shadow is a phenomenon that occurs because the light goes straight. When a straight light encounters an opaque object, a shadow is created. What if the light doesn't go straight and it's meandering? Even if there is an object, it can bend to the back of the object, so there is no shadow.

   2 The exhibition hall explains the principles of science encountered in everyday life and shows the science that meets the future, the universe, and the ocean. It is a space to experience and understand the science behind life, sports, and play. You can see why the roller coaster does not fall when it is flipped over, and what is the secret of moving the snowboard.

It is a space where you can meet interesting science principles in the universe, nature, the human body, and life.

   Let's check the screening time of the theaters located in each exhibition hall in advance. 1 In the exhibition hall 3D theater, &lt;Rocket Launch&gt;, &lt;Becoming a Space Flight&gt;, and &lt;The World Created by Light&gt; are screened. Astronomical theaters, 4D cinemas, and 4D simulators, which require separate tickets, show more vivid and interesting images.

   There are many things to see outdoors. With a observatory facility moving on the bus, Lucerium Staka is a space where you can observe the sunspots and red flames and meet the solar system. Playgrounds that shape the universe and planets are also popular with children. From the playground side, the exterior of the science museum as if it were a space creature is also impressive.

   The closing time for viewing the science museum is 5:30 pm, and the summer sun is still in full bloom. Gwangju-Kia Champions Field is recommended as a great place to enjoy a late afternoon. It's hot, but I want to play some baseball, but when I go to the scene, it's different. When the heat of the day cools and the evening breeze blows, you can watch the game full of passion.

   Gwangju-Kia Champions Field opened in March 2014 and boasts state-of-the-art facilities. Of the 22,000 seats, 19,246 are infield seats. It reflects the culture of Korean spectators who like to watch infield. The distance from home plate to spectator seat is 18.5m, which is the shortest among the national baseball fields. Various convenience facilities were installed in 229 seats for the handicapped, and they were also certified as a living environment without disabilities (BF).

   If you bought an outfield ticket, pack a mat and go in. Of the 2,754 outfield seats, about half are grass. Sitting here requires laying mats to protect the grass and prevent exposure to pests. If you don't have a mat, you can sit on a long bench-shaped seat. Since there are two playgrounds in the outfield, children who are not interested in baseball play in the sand, and parents who play mats nearby enjoy family outing and baseball. In addition to chicken, a menu that is indispensable to the ballpark, the outfield seat is the best for spreading and eating food. In the summer, most of the game starts at 6:30 PM, so we eat dinner while watching the game.
