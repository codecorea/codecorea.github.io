Stone Jangseung was built from the past with people's well-being and hope at the mouth of the village. In Heewon, there are more than 100 pairs of bucks.

Rainwater accumulates in one stone that seems to be indifferent, and the sky is filled.

It is a scenery that needs to be read at once, like a sentence in a book.

   Ascending the granite staircase, you will meet the stone pillars that support the grass yard in front of the Hoam Art Museum. It is also called “flower stone” because it has patterns in giant stones that are slightly different in shape and size. It is said to have been built and airlifted from all over the country. Stones with clear patterns, like white flowers bloom, tell the story as if they are alive, and giraffe and ivy grown in the gap breathe life into a huge stone foundation. Buddhist statues, such as Seokjodangchomungwangbae, stand in front of the base, and you can feel godliness.

The moon-shaped round town hall stands next to Woldae, where bucks with various faces and facial expressions gather together. Each iris, baboon blossoms under a towering pine tree, and two peacocks play freely in search of food. If you stand with your back against the art museum and appreciate the mountain ridges surrounding the guard, the pace of walking into the art museum is slow and slow.
