   What do you think of when you Pohang? With Homigot's hands facing each other on the sea and land, and Jukdo Market, which has everything except for nothing, delicious Guryongpo snow crab and Guamegi, and Naeyeonsan Bogyeongsa Temple and Unjesan Orsa are followed. Posco, which is a giant of Pohang economy and boasts a great night view, is regrettable. At this point, it seems that I have almost traveled to the destination of Pohang. To this, let's add the Guryongpo Modern History Museum, which opened in 2012. In the meantime, Pohang, which has been stored only as a famous spot for sunrise and as a delicious beach, will come.

   Why is there a Japanese house in Guryongpo?
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   There is a place in Pohang Guryongpo called 'Japanese House Street'. As the name suggests, it is a place where Japanese houses were concentrated. Only a few years ago, people who knew only came and looked through the winding alleys. In 2012, with the opening of Guryongpo Modern History Museum, it was neatly arranged in the name of 'Guryongpo Japanese House Street', and the path of those who visited Guryongpo continues. Why are there Japanese-style houses here? Most of the old buildings have been renovated, but considering the size of the house, it can be seen that it was a house with a manufacturing department.

   It is known that the Japanese entered Guryongpo about 100 years ago. The fishing boats of Kagawa Prefecture came to this place after a group of fish. Later, many Japanese fishermen moved to Guryongpo. It can be seen that in 1932, the number reached 300 households, which was quite large. According to data from Guryongpo Modern History Museum, it is known that the first fishermen in Kagawa Prefecture appeared in the waters of the Korean Peninsula from around 1880 to 1884. At the time, the Seto Inland Sea of Kagawa Prefecture had a narrow fishing ground, and the fishermen's disputes continued. Eventually, helpless fishermen went to the distant sea in search of wider fishing grounds and settled on the Korean Peninsula with abundant fishery resources.

   The meat was plentiful, so he had no choice but to raise money. The wealthy Japanese built their homes, such as ship management, ship transportation, and canning processing factories, and Japanese collective residences began to form. The streets with restaurants, bakeries, pubs, department stores, and inns flourished and grew into the largest downtown area in Guryongpo. You can see the revival period of Guryongpo at that time with the remaining Japanese-style houses. About 80 houses remain at a distance of about 500m.

   What is the main reason Japanese people have been able to settle in Guryongpo? This is because it is the Japanese colonial power that changed the history of Korea in the 20th century. In the same context, it is not only difficult to see Japanese-style houses in the seaside towns of the South Sea, such as Busan or Tongyeong, as well as Pohang. In August 1910, the Korean Empire disappeared, and the Japanese occupation continued until the defeat of Japan in August 1945. It coincides with the time when Japanese fishermen entered Guryongpo.

   Guryongpo The easiest way to enter a Japanese street is to go to the Guryongpo Post Office. When you enter the alley with the post office on the left, the streets of Guryongpo Japanese houses spread out. Each building has an old picture and a description, so it's fun to compare. Houses of a different shape than ours attract attention.

   Let's take a look at the stories the buildings have. The building with the sign &lt;Hohomyeonok&gt; was &lt;Daedeung Inn&gt;, the best accommodation in Guryongpo at the time. It is now a restaurant where you can taste cold noodles. &lt;Frusato&gt;, which now houses a Japanese tea house, was a popular restaurant &lt;Ilsimjeong&gt; 80 years ago. If you follow the buildings like this, you will see a stairway to the left. This is the way to Guryongpo Park.

   If you enter the main entrance, go to the Guryongpo Modern History Museum. You can also get a brochure with the description of the resident cultural commentator. Closed on Mondays. The Guryongpo Modern History Building was built by Gengichi Hashimoto from Kagawa Prefecture in the 1920s. Construction materials were imported from Japan to build a two-story Japanese-style wooden house. A typical Japanese house with a charming garden and Japanese-style tatami mats can be explored in every corner.
