    We prepared a “Special Delivery” destination to blow the heat in late summer. The main characters are the Jeongseon Hwaam Cave, which cools in the middle of the summer, the Cheonggok Cave in the East Sea, and “Ghost Park” located in Hapcheon Video Theme Park.

    “Once upon a time, when I went to the bathroom, there was always no tissue. Then I can hear the sound. 'Would you like red tissue paper or blue tissue paper?'
    <br/>
    When did it start? As a child, I always heard scary stories during summer vacation. I can't see grandmothers and grandfathers who used to hold my grandchildren's hands with my hard hands and talk about old days, but I still remember the 'frightful story' that I wore over and over in the middle of summer. Children in the perfect toilet era prepared a destination for the 2014 Napyang Special Feature, starting with the story of the “Puse style toilet ghost story” that is difficult to understand. Even in midsummer, the cool main lines are the Hwaam Cave, the East Sea Cheongok Cave, and Hapcheon Ghost Park. In addition, there are a lot of scary spaces like the “ghost house” in the amusement park, but let's go to the cave of Gangwon-kwon where you can take a summer trip and the “interactive ghost house” that evolved.
   </p>
  </div>
  <strong class="ar_title">
   Coolness is basic, and chilling is a bonus cave experience!
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   First, let's go to the Jeongseon Hwaam Cave. The Hwaam Cave, which was discovered in search of gold mines, is already a popular destination for summer travel. From the parking lot to the entrance of the cave, you can go by foot or monorail, but walking is fast when there are many people. However, when you enjoy the horror experience in the late afternoon, you must travel through the monorail. Even if you climb up with sweat, once you enter the cave, it will soon cool. At the entrance, protagonists who experience horror in the summer season are introduced. Characters that will be 'blemished' are welcomed by scared people, including the nine tailed fox, werewolf, virgin ghost, gangshi, and mummy.
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The 2014 Jeongseon Hwaam Cave horror experience will last for about a month until August 17th. It runs every 30 minutes from 7 pm to 11 pm. It is creepy from entering a dark cave in the middle of the night. Those who have experience in the cave know the characteristics of the cave, which is completely blocked outside even in daylight, but if not, it is better to experience the cave in advance before the horror experience. There must be companions during the day. It's a horror experience, but if you move in groups during the off-season, if you go to the cave during the off-season, walking alone through the cave that reaches about 1800m from the entrance to the exit of the Hwaam Cave is a burden.

   If you want to experience the horror experience of the Hwaam Cave, you must make a reservation in advance. This is because reservations are closed two days before the experience date. Up to 360 people are allowed per day, of which 140 are reserved for internet. The rest and the rest of the people are available on a first-come, first-served basis. If you still can't make a reservation in advance, let's aim at 7pm, the first time in the horror experience. For the first time (from 7 pm to 7:30 pm), 100% of the experience and tickets for 40 people will be held on the same day as on-site ticketing. From 8:00 PM, 20 people each will purchase tickets on the Internet and on-site. The experience fee plus monorail and horror experience is 12,000 won for adults, 10,000 won for teenagers, and 5000 won for children. You can also experience “Watching Outdoor Movies in the Midsummer Night”, which is conducted as an additional facility before moving on to the monorail. Information can be directed to the Facility Management Corporation (033-562-7062).

   The horror experience of the Hwaam Cave, which you may be most curious about, reveals a little. First, turn off all the lights inside the cave. Even in the middle of the day, a dark cave lights up inside to secure visibility. But what if you turn off all the lights? In this state, only a flashlight is used to explore the 1803m cave. In this situation, people dressed as maidens, grim reapers, mummy pop out. They know that they are fakes, but they are 'thrilling' when they raid in the chewing cave.

   Next is the Donghae Chungok Cave. Thanks to maintaining 14 degrees during the four seasons, even in the summer, the cool Chungok Cave began a “Cheongok Cave Horror Experience” two years ago. It is similar to the horror experience of other caves. After extinguishing the inside of the cave, it relies on a flashlight and moves in groups of 5 for 1 hour. The ghosts appearing along with the sound of thunder and lightning make people shimmer.
