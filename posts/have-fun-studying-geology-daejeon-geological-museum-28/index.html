   How old is the earth? After 4.6 billion years of age, the earth has been constantly transformed by volcanoes, earthquakes, etc., and the birth and evolution of life has continued.

   The word "geology" gives a heavy feeling. However, it is also geologically accessible to anyone if they start with a light question, such as what land I'm walking on and what material the foot is. The Geological Museum of Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources, located in Daedeok Science Research Complex, the center of Korean science, is tailored in that sense.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The Geological Museum was opened in 2001 after the formation of the Geological Sampler at the Daejeon Expo in 1993, and as the importance of museums with various geology and related contents emerged. This place is filled with traces of anxiety to build properly from the exterior. Designed from a pentagon-shaped stegosaurus corrugated building, the building combines with a large lawn walkway featuring large rocks and mineral specimens and fossils to create a more unique look.
