    I go early in the morning. Soongneung opened this year. Sungneung is the 18th Joseon Dynasty and the tomb of Queen Myeongseong. It has been closed for many years among the nine tombs of the copper hills, and was opened to the public earlier this year. The Sungneung revealed the first fresh green. The road to “Secret Nest” is a cozy forest path that has not been reached by foreigners for a while. The morning forest is deep, and the birdsong is perfect. In short, Sungneung in the early morning is a serene tomb without the crowds of the three.

   'Viewing restricted area'. It is a long tag attached to Sungneung to protect cultural properties. Even if you look at the guide to Donggureung, it is at the end of the recommended viewing course. Walking around Donggungneung is somewhat slow when you see famous kings such as Geonneung of Taejo, Mokneung of Seonjo, and Wonneung of Yeongjo. The sun is hot, and the tombs and the Jeongjagak in front of the tombs and the Hongsalmun are all similar. When you come to Hyeungneung, the tomb of King Gyeongjong, you are more excited about relaxation than walking. Soongneung in the tranquil forest is so fresh and shining.

   The beauty of the Donggureung walking is not all about standing on a tomb. The dirt road that connects the tombs and tombs is an excitement. Already there is a great value in walking among world heritage sites. Trees that have kept the royal tomb for many years are lined up on the promenade with their backs bent. Firs, oaks, camellia, pines, etc. are like the king's servants who have been together for centuries. In the forest, light green moss grows, and when you stand on it, it feels like you step on a warm carpet. A handful of sunlight flows through the trees, and a thin stream flows as if breaking the silence on the roadside. Such a quiet atmosphere stands on the promenade leading to Sungneung.

    Stories entangled in Sungneung lead the trail to a deeper thought. Hyunjong was born in the Qing Dynasty, the only foreign king of Joseon. The son was obtained when his father, Bongrimdaegun (Hyojong) was taken as a hostage to the Qing Dynasty after the illness. Hyeonjong tried to establish the order of the Joseon Dynasty, which was shaken during the impoverishment of the Imjin and the sick when he reached the throne at the age of 19. He stopped the reckless punishment policy and enforced the Daedong law in Honam.

    Sungneung is made up of Ssangneung. Queen Myeongseong, the queen, is asleep. The specialty that stands out in Sungneung is the pavilion of the king's sacred spirit during the ceremony. It is the only one of the royal tombs of Joseon Dynasty, and it is unique. Sungneung's pavilion is designated Treasure No. 1782. In addition to Jeongjakgak, the relics of the structures around the Royal Tombs will be renewed. A stream flows out of the royal tomb, and this stream serves as the boundary between the world and the sanctuary. The bridge over the stream is called Geumcheon Bridge. Hongsalmun on the red pillar in front of the royal tomb is a sign that it is a sacred area, and the path leading from Hongsalmun to Jeongjakga is different in height from the left and right. The road on the left is the Shinto shrine of the gods, and the road on the right is the shrine of the kings. The monument that records the king's achievements is to the right of the pavilion, and sculptures of animal figures such as Seokma, Seokyang, and Lagoon surround the royal tomb. In front of the tomb, there is a structure in which unmanned and moon inseoks stand side by side. Sungneung's Moon In-seok has a gentle expression, and his open-mouthed uninhabited figure is stolen. Each tomb has its own personality, and the statues are slightly different.

   The UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Royal Tombs of Joseon, 40 of the 42 royal tombs are located in South Korea, and 9 of them belong to the copper tomb. It is the largest in Korea on the scale of Joseon Royal Tombs. However, the historical value that the soul of the Joseon Dynasty was standing for more than 500 years is not convincing. The fascination of Donggureung is due to the dense forest and nature. Trees growing on moss-covered grounds have created the best trails to imitate.

   A silver grass grows differently in Geonneung of Taejo. It is said that Taejo wanted to be buried in his hometown, which he usually missed in the last years, so he brought soil and silver grass from his hometown of Yeongheung and planted it in bonbon. Also, on top of the Jeongjagung of Geonneung, there is a square stone coordination so that people can bow at the bottom. Among the royal tombs of the Joseon Dynasty, Geonneung is the only place in the Joseon Dynasty. Moon and Muinseok in Hyeonneung, where Moon Jong is asleep, have funny faces. At the entrance to the tomb of the ancestral ancestors, there was a colony of hornbeam trees.

   Sungneung is a must visit in the early morning. During the summer season, the gates of Donggureung open at 6 am. When visitors come and go, when the sublime silence and the dense forest are combined rather than the noise of the world, you can realize that the forest and the castle are quietly embraced. In the past, it would not have been possible to inadvertently encounter the royal tomb, and the encounter with the royal tomb would not have been so fuss-free. As it did long ago, the royal tombs and forest roads that meet in the same atmosphere even after hundreds of years are more and more heartwarming.

   The saints spread a mat beside the stream or the grass and enjoy the afterlife given by the king. It is also fun to watch the video of the Royal Tomb's construction process at the historical museum at the entrance of the ticket office. On holidays, a commentary for visitors is provided, and a forest experience program for children is also provided. It is a great blessing for descendants to have a meaningful, charming, and quiet promenade near the space of life.
