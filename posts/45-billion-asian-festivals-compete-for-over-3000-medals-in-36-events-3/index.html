   Traditional medallion archery. The Republic of Korea breathes on a single arrow that cuts off the target. Archery won eight gold medals, including the 2014 Incheon Asian Games and the newly added compound. In the men's group qualification round (compound) held on the 23rd, Choi Yong-hee (2nd) and Yang Young-ho (5th) played in the men's individual qualification round. The women's team also took first place in the Compound Women's Qualifying Round and Choi Bo-min (1st) and Seok Ji-hyun (2nd) in the individual qualification round. The game is played every day until the 28th.
   <br/>
   Wait here! There are two types of archery: a recurve bow and a compound bow. All archery we have seen in the meantime is recurve. Compound archery hasn't been an Olympic or Asian competition. However, attention has been increasing as it was adopted as a regular sport since the Incheon Asian Games. What is the difference between the two? As the name implies, the bow structure is different. If the recurve is a traditional bow, the compound is a mechanical bow. The recurve is heavy and sensitive, so the player's concentration is important. Thinking of the archery field in the meantime makes it easier to understand. Compounds, on the other hand, are lighter and smaller than mechanical arrowhead recurve arrows that are easy to learn for beginners with pulleys and sights.
   <br/>
   In the finals of the badminton men's team where the opposition hero Lee Yong-dae played on the 23rd, he added a gold medal. The men's and women's mixed singles and doubles games will be held until the 29th. In addition, medal competitions will be held in 36 events including judo, shooting, cycling, and land. As of September 24, 2014, South Korea is ranked second overall with 61 medals, including 20 gold, 19 silver and 22 bronze.

   Indeed, don't forget the seal of three children, Vichuon, Barame, and Chumyeon, the mascots of the Incheon Asian Games. The mascot of the convention has influenced the image of the competition. As the name suggests, the eldest son of the Incheon Asian Games, Bichuon, is, as the name suggests, 'the messenger of light shining hope on the whole world'. Was taken from. Why don't you enjoy the festival of autumn, wind, light and wind?
