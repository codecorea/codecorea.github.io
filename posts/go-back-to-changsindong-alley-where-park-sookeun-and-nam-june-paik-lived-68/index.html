   Changsin-dong and Sungin-dong are the villages outside the city where the common people lived outside the city of Hanyang. As soon as you descend the castle and turn around, the trails are well maintained outside the castle and the Changsin-dong alleys are connected. Changsin-dong is still a cluster of 2,000 sewing factories. As you walk in the alleys, you will hear a sewing machine sound through the window frame of a small sewing factory between a steep hill and a curved alley. Recently, as a part of the city's urban regeneration project, themed alleys will be built around the sewing alleys and the sewing museum will be built.

You can get a glimpse of the hanok between the alleys. Now exit the market alley and down the street. In front of Woori Bank, you can see the signpost of Changshin Market, exit 3 of Dongdaemun Station (Lines 1 and 4). Turn left into the small alley and you will see Seongjin Super on the corner. It is a raw garter (197-33, Changsin-dong, Jongno-gu) by video artist Nam June Paik (1932 ~ 2006).

  <div class="txt_p">
   Unfortunately, Nam June Paik's house was torn down in the 1950s and operated as a restaurant until recently, but it was bought by the city of Seoul in August to create a cultural exhibition space to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Nam June Paik's death next year. Nam June Paik was born in Changpo and lived in Changsin-dong until he was 18 years old. Nam June Paik's house, which had a total area of 9,900m², was a hanok, a rich house with a cadillac, which was the only two in Korea. He finished his work in 2004 after finishing his last presentation. In an interview at the time, he said, "I want to go to Changsin-dong where I grew up." I can't look inside the house, but I'm glad that it will be a new cultural space next year.

This alley is nothing short of Treasure Island in the eyes of the children who hold the hands of mom and dad on the weekend. Princesses who can't keep their eyes in front of large dolls and princes who hold their toy cars and howl are making memories forever.

   It's a pity, but if you illuminate Park's life, its meaning comes to me. Park Su-geun, who is considered to have the strongest Korean colors, is accompanied by a qualifier called 'Sum Minhwa'. His masterpieces, including Wells, Washer, and Roadside, were all born in Changshin-dong. He drew common people who sat in alleys and markets. The old man squatted with children and the peddlers were models. Park Soo-geun lived in Changsin-dong from 1952 to 1963 and portrayed many common people until he died of illness.

   Park Su-geun, a poor painter who loved the common people, walks to Sungnye-dong Dongmyo Flea Market. The Dongmyo Flea Market, which is held only on weekends, retains the alleys and marketplaces of old times, and has recently attracted attention as a new cultural playground. Dongmyo is located in the center of the marketplace, and it has been called Dongmyo Flea Market. The tomb is the shrine of Confucius. The market place runs like a spider's web in a small alley, centering on the tomb and the main street. On weekends, young couples holding their hands, lovers on a date, and blue-eyed foreign tourists who are interested in our culture are common. As you slowly look around the marketplace, you can see the people in the paintings. It overlaps with the faces of the alleys that the poor painters faced.
