    The library has changed. Let's leave the hard space you're looking for to read, borrow, or study. Here, there is a smart and stylish library with plenty of books, DVDs and equipment for design work filled in a spacious space. The main character is the Seoul Library, which entered the old city hall in Seoul.

    Do you remember the square in front of the city hall that was swayed by the red wave in 2002? At the time when the people who made the World Cup semifinals myth were hot, the Seoul Plaza was reborn as a communication space for citizens in the 'City Hall Front Yard'. Since 2004, it has been named 'Seoul Plaza' through the competition, and it has become an open space where citizens naturally come and go through various transformations such as exhibitions and skating rinks every season.

   Today's destination is the Seoul Library, with Seoul Plaza as its front yard. The reason I first introduced the Seoul Plaza is because of the relationship between the Seoul Plaza and the Seoul Library and their “needle and thread”. Just looking at what was called “City Hall (front) Plaza” before getting the name of Seoul Plaza, you can read that he was part of the city hall rather than an independent space now. If you look at Dongseon, the Seoul Plaza continues as soon as you come out of the main entrance of the Seoul Library.

   Let's take a look around Seoul Plaza for a moment. Deoksugung Daehan Gate can be seen across the pedestrian crossing between the building forests. A stone wall path with a rumor of breaking up with a loved one continues. It is a beautiful road no matter how you look at it.

   If you look around, go to Seoul Library. The building's exterior that reveals the time he has embraced attracts attention. The Seoul Library, which has been remodeled for four years, opened in 2012 as a representative library in Seoul with over 200,000 books. Until then, it was the Seoul City Hall.

   The building, built in 1926, was the office of the Gyeongseong Ministry during the Japanese colonial period, and was used as the office building of Seoul after liberation. For more than 80 years, his identity, which has clearly seen the modern and contemporary history of South Korea in the same place in the center of Seoul, is a cultural property (Registered Cultural Property No. 52). The new office building in Seoul took place right behind the old office building (Seoul Library). Jung-gu, to which he belongs, is still the center of Seoul.

    This is the address of Seoul Library, 110 Sejong-daero, Jung-gu, Seoul. When you come out of Exit 5 of City Hall Station on Subway Lines 1 and 2, you can see them immediately. If you still look at the Seoul library building, it seems to tell you the history he had from the Japanese occupation period to the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup. In any era, the closed space, which boasted a high threshold that the common people could not dare to enter, entered the 21st century and became an open space and library that anyone could carry. There are many things to talk about by itself.

    After entering the main entrance of the Seoul Library and passing the stairs, it is the second floor where the central information desk is located. The book cafes 'Booksai' and 'Digital Archive' are together, and 'General Archive 2' is located in a different space. In the digital library, you can view video and audio materials, the Internet, and digital electronic newspapers. Movie and animation DVD viewing and rental are available. In addition, there is a “smart office” space where you can work on Photoshop and illustrations, so many workers come to visit. Computers are all reserved. You can use it for a fixed period of time at a reserved place. The book cafe ‘Book Sai’ is a place where you can relax more comfortably. It is good to cool your head with a magazine placed on a bookshelf.

All are only available for indoor viewing, and cannot be borrowed. It is interesting to see the history of Seoul City Hall at a glance. In addition, the Mayor's office, the reception room, and the planning room during the old government building were restored to draw attention. At that time, the atmosphere was conveyed. On the 4th floor, you can check the materials provided by the embassies and cultural centers of each country and foreign periodicals. Loans are not possible.

    It is often thought that a library is a place you need to hurry to study or to borrow books you want to read. However, it is time to forget about the old library in a stiff and cool space. Even if you don't have to read or borrow a book, the Seoul Library is a great place to rest. Couples who have different tastes for movies can pick up their favorite movies from the digital library where DVDs can be viewed at any time. If you are thinking about where to go on weekends with your child, go to the Seoul Library. It will be the best place to go on a date with a book in the center of Seoul, waiting for spring.
