    From Bonghwa-eup to Cheongnyangsan Mountain, you must go through the locations of Bongseong-myeon and Myeongho-myeon. Around the Bongseong-myeon, the gentle fragrance stops the foot. In particular, by the time the navel clock makes a loud noise, white smoke rises from the chimneys of Bongseong-myeon, like smoke from Bonghwa-myeon, and the fragrant smell of mouth-watering punctures the nose. This is the scent of pork charcoal grilled from Bongseong Pork Charcoal Fire Complex.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Charcoal-grilled Bongseong pork has a long history. Looking at the history of Bongseong-myeon first, it was called Bongseong-hyeon during the Goryeo Dynasty and was renamed Bonghwa-hyeon during the Goryeo Dynasty. In the Bongseong Pork Charcoal Fire Complex, the old Bonghwahyeon Gwanah building, Bongseoru (Gyeongsangbuk-do Cultural Properties No. 418) remains, so you can see the old traces.

   From the old days, there was a marketplace where people and products gathered in a major town. In Bongseong, there was also a long history of bon-growth since Goryeo Dynasty. In particular, the right market was large. The history of Bongseong Pork's charcoal-grilled fire begins with Bongseong. Pork charcoal grilled food is served as a meal or as a snack to people from all over the world. Since the Goryeo Dynasty, it has been passed down to the present, boasting a history of over a thousand years. It is known that the “Macchik” eaten by the people of the Mack people considered to be our ancestors, and “Seolya”, which is said to have come from Mongolia during the Goryeo Dynasty, is known as the origin of Korean bulgogi. Wasn't Bongseong Pork charcoal grilling a tradition or a shoulder-to-shoulder traditional food?

   When a grill with meat is placed on top of a charcoal fire, a full-scale dwarf spreads. When the charcoal fires with the sound of meat being grilled, it is like watching a fireworks display. Just looking at it makes me feel full and filled with hungry stomach.

   Charcoal fires use pine charcoal rather than oak. This is because the charcoal fire is not strong and soft, and it is well lit. Pork mainly uses sows that are less vulnerable. Put the thickly sliced meat on the grill, salt it and bake it over and over again.

   It is important to grill the meat so that it does not burn. Although it seems to be flipped over by eyes, the skill of baking moderately is the master's skill derived from many years of experience. As the meat matures, the oil falls flat under the grill, and the white smoke that burns the oil goes out on a high chimney.

   When the meat is properly cooked, the unique recipe of Bongseong Pork Charcoal Grill is added. It is a pine needle. The scent of pine needles removes the smell of meat and makes the taste lighter. It is said that the terpene ingredient from pine needles is absorbed into meat and is also good for preventing adult diseases. Put the pine needles on the meat and bake it again, then put the pine needles on the plate again, put the meat on it, and immediately go out to the top. It's baked in the kitchen right away, so it tastes as good as it's grilled on a charcoal fire.

   Cheongnyang Mountain and sky bridge in autumn
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   From Bongseong Pork Charcoal Fire Complex, take Route 35 to Andong, passing Myeongho-myeon to reach Cheongnyangsan. It was the place where Kim Chi-won, who was superior to Choi Chi-won of the Silla language and Wang Hee-ji of China, did the capital and where King Kong Gongmin escaped the difficulties of Hong Geon-jeok. During the Joseon Dynasty, Toegye Lee Hwang studied at Cheongnyangjeongsa Temple. Mr. Se-Boo Joo toured Cheongnyang Mountain and named it 'Yukyukbong'. It is a mountain that often contains 12 generations, 8 oysters, and 4 tablets. In autumn, the autumn leaves in harmony with the rock formations are the best part.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    There are several courses to climb to Cheongnyangsan Mountain. The course that climbs Cheongnyangsa Temple and the rear thread head and the course that climbs through Eungjinjeon and Gimsaenggul at the standing are the most. The course through Cheongnyangsa and the back thread can be reached the fastest, but the slope is steep. On the other hand, the standing course is a course where you can enjoy the autumn leaves of Cheongnyangsan Mountain and enjoy the hidden history. The standing course can be climbed almost effortlessly, except for the entrance to the entrance, the road to Eungjinjeon, and the road from Gimsaenggul to Jasobong.
    <br/>
    When you pass a steep dirt road, the fallen leaves quickly turn into a lush trail. It's a steep road with shortness of breath. The beauty of the yellow and red maple leaves seems to hold my breath once again. If you climb about 10 minutes, you will get a forked road. One side is the way to Cheongnyangsa Temple and the other to Eungjinjeon. The road to Eungjinjeon is also a difficult climb. However, if you take a step by step, you will be rewarded properly as it is difficult. Eungjinjeon, standing like hanging on Cheongnyangsan Mountain, is wrapped in autumn leaves.
   </p>
   <p>
    In particular, you can see the scenery of Cheongnyangsan Mountain near Eoungdae and Chongmyeongsu after passing Eungjinjeon. Cheongnyangsa Temple and Cheongnyangsan Mountain unfold like a watercolor in Eoungdae, and the three-story stone pagoda and Yeonhwabong Peak of Cheongnyangsa Temple protruding from the path of Gimsaenggul.

   <p>
    It is the most difficult course from Kim Saeng-gul to Jasobong. If you climb the ridge in less than an hour, it is a long time to reach the sky bridge. The light green sky bridge is a 90m long bridge that connects the Jaranbong and Seonhakbong of Cheongnyangsan Mountain. It is made in the form of a suspension bridge, but it is a rigid bridge. People who cross this bridge experience heaven and hell. Because it is literally a sky bridge floating at 800m high.
   </p>
   <p>
    I didn't walk the moment I climbed the bridge, but I can feel a slight tremor. When you take a step, it starts to shake, and the movement of people crossing from the other side adds up, and it starts to slam. The feet are dark and the whole body shakes, so it is truly thrilling as if you are going between heaven and hell.
