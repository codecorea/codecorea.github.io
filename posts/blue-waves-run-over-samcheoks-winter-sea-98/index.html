    Listening to the group's blue sky song, `` Winter Seas, '' I miss the winter sea so much that I want to leave right away. I remember going to the sea long ago listening to this song. The bitter sea breeze and cold winds up the body, but the deep blue sea and the dazzling white waves dig into the chest. The winter sea meets comfort and hope more than beauty. The waters of Samcheok, Gangwon-do have the most beautiful colors and have cute beaches and coastal roads. Let's meet the winter sea along Samcheok's coastal road that leads to the coast instead of National Highway 7.

   Samcheok begins, from Jeungsan Beach to Alley Beach

  <div class="txt_p">
   Samcheok's sea begins at Jeungsan Beach. Jeungsan is a village nestled between Chamjae, which leads to Chuam, and Wowsan, which passes to Samcheok Beach. The beach just over 200m ahead of the village is named Jeungsan Beach.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   There is a coastal trail connecting Chuam Beach and Jeungsan Beach in the East Sea. It is a short walk of less than 300m along the coastal cliff, but it is an observation point where the landscape of candlestick rock, which is a specialty of Chuam Beach, and the surrounding rock formations unfold. If you drive by car from Jeungsan Beach to Chuam Beach, you have to travel at least 4km long.

   Samcheok Beach is visited by many Japanese. This is because Yon-sama Bae Yong-joon is the filming location for the movie Staring Out. The original name was backward beach, but changed to Samcheok beach because it was not good. The small beach that goes further south from Samcheok Beach still remains as a small backward beach.

   There are many cafes on Samcheok Beach where you can spend a relaxing time. Among them, one cafe decorated with sky blue is outstanding. It is a sea pepe that means “a cafe in front of the beach.” The “I love you” sculpture of Samcheok Beach is directly overlooked. The interior is impressive, with two windows on the right side of the cafe, allowing me to look out through the window.

   Samcheok's representative coastal road is the Millennium Coastal Road. The road was built to commemorate the Millennium in 2000. The road along the coastal cliffs makes the landscape quite impressive. There are always coastal roads bent along the coastline, as well as cool waves that drive off the seashore and the shore. The Millennium Coastal Road runs about 5 km from Samcheok Beach to Samcheok Port.

   Gungchon to Yonghwa is a famous section for marine rail bikes. Rail bikes are famous, but few people find coastal roads from Gungchon to Yonghwa Beach. Crossing Gungchon Bridge, you will find coastal roads leading to Wonpyeong Beach, Munam Beach and Chogok Port. The road runs alongside marine rail bikes. As you approach Chogok Harbor, you can see the observation deck on the rocks. It is worth noting because there is a bow-shaped Moonam beach, the surrounding sea rocks, Chogok Harbor Breakwater, and a rock that resembles a Maison Samjon Buddha with a coffin.

There is a small road leading to Namhwa Volcano just before the officers' office. The road to the top of the park is also difficult. It is a narrow cement road that reaches 2.5km and is very steep. But if you reach the top as hard as you can, the open sea is waiting for you. The promenade is made with various sculptures based on the story in Samguk Yusa.

Across from Gigokcheon, a huge gray structure catches the eye. LNG production base is located. Side by side with the gray structure, Sol Island, famous for being photographed by British photographer Michael Kenna. As the LNG production base enters, only Solsum remains, but the surrounding area is desolate. It is even more sorrowful than ever when the LNG production base enters Solseom, which was at the center of the legal battle against Michael Kenna's photographic copyright issue.
