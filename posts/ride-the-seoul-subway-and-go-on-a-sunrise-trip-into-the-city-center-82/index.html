   Acha Sunrise Point is a sunrise square built on the mountainside. It is 1.5km from Mt. The stairs leading up to the camel ridge are a bit steep but are not very difficult. Street lamps are installed in many places, so there is less burden on the dark dawn. Climb the Camel Ridge to see Goguryeo-jeong and climb the short rock section to get to the Sunrise Square. There are two observation decks around the rock. Tip one here. From the direction of progress, the observation deck on the left can see the dawn of the city, and the observation deck on the right can see the sunrise in harmony with the Han River. So if you want to see both of them at the same time? The first answer is right behind Sunrise Square. Climb up to a hill-shaped tower, and you can see the Han River, Gangnam area, and Bukhansan mountain in the front. There are only 30m of altitude difference between the 4th and 1st base of Acha Mountain, so if you find Mt.
