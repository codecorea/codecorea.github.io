   #One. Uljin Wangpicheon, full of wild charm
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Wangpicheon is a 61km-long waterway that flows from Wangpi-ri and Gusan-ri to Uljin, originating from the nutritional defense of Gyeongbuk. Surrounded by mountains and cliffs, it was not easy to reach, so people were less likely to walk, and thanks to it, it was considered a clean area to recognize. The name 'Wangpiri', meaning 'town where the king has fled', also indicates that this area was remote. It is in the same context that Wangpicheon area was designated as an ecological and landscape conservation area in 2005. It is the largest in Korea. In 2013, four ecological trails were opened in the vicinity of Wangpicheon and designated as eco-tourism areas, where local residents operate the Wangpicheon Eco Tour Group.

   The starting point of this Wangpicheon trekking course was taken to Gulguji Village. Gulguji Village, which is considered to be an outback in Uljin, is a name that says that only nine bends should go around the mountain. The trekking route between Wangpicheon Soksa Village, upstream of Wangpicheon and Gulguji Village, downstream of Gusan-ri, is the most successful. Either way, you can start, but if you are a beginner or a child with little trekking experience, it is recommended that you start at Goolji Village and return to the camp. The valley is gentle and you can trek gently.

    Wonderful scenery follows the quiet stream. Nevertheless, I am not careful that the water is shallow. Mossy stones are slippery. In addition, the Gulguji Village ~ Sangcheondong ~ Yongso ~ Turtle Rock Observation Course belongs to the 2nd course of the Wangpicheon Ecological Trail, so you can walk on the forest path, not the water path. If you are walking in the valley and become crowded, you can also climb the forest path. Still, trekking in the valley is recommended to properly see the skin of Wang Picheon. Walk about 4km from Gulguji Village and you will reach the best view of the Wangpicheon. The area where the dragon seems to be floundering must be violated due to the steep and rough cliffs. If individual valley trekking is a burden, you can use ecological exploration at the Wangpicheon Eco Tour Group.

   Inje morning valley where lush native forest and clean valley are combined. It means 'in the midst of a spooky mountain, where it is only about a year to plow the field in the morning'. It is a valley that still has the feeling of outback, as its name suggests. Morning Garrigol originated from Guryong Deokbong, flows about 20km and meets Bangtaecheon of Dongdongri, especially the 5km downstream section. In addition, the slope is gentle, so it is easy to go up the valley. The water path is easier to walk than the forest path, which is hard to see.

   Trekking in the morning is going to start at the opposite side of the vibratory valley, Sanchon Cultural Recreation Center (or Vibratory Mountain House). As soon as you cross the vibrating valley, the forest path in the thick forest begins. As soon as you pass through the lush forest, you can go morning and reach the downstream. The origin return course that goes back and forth from the morning Gargol-Jogyeongdong bridge to Bangdong Yaksu is the most successful. If you want to see upstream in the morning, you need about 10 hours. If the distance is a burden, it is also a good idea to enjoy the water in the vibrating valley after watching the morning goal.

   # 3. Deep mountain valley road, Jeongseon Deoksangi Valley

  <div class="txt_p">
   Deoksangi Valley, one of Jeongseon's remote areas. It was a secret valley known only to people who knew it until it was introduced to TV programs. It was revealed to the world when it was chosen as a place for outdoor weddings by famous celebrities, but the still waters still remain.

  <div class="txt_p">
   With a total length of 12km, there are Dosagok, Deoksangi, and Hebei-dong villages in the valley of Deoksangi, which is surrounded by Songdae. Dozens of households lived on the ground and left for flooding in 1979. Guest houses and pensions are located along the valley. In general, we find many courses from Deokuri to Budong-ri.
