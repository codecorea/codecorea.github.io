   I saw a piece of wood erected on a plate of water at a vinyl house flower shop. There is no root, but one green leaf growing on a piece of wood leaves a long aftertaste. Sometimes when your head is heavy and your heart feels dry, imagine putting your mind on a plate of water. Then I draw a picture of a leaf coming out of my mind, but it still works quite well. This time, I tried to raise my mind and body in the 'Korean Folk Village', a village where folklore is high.

    On October 3, 1974, the Korean Folk Village was opened. Beyond the door is the space where the lives of the people of the Joseon Dynasty, which became increasingly distant as time passed, were revealed. Although it is not a person's house, it is a house where people lived, but the story of flowers and folklore is engulfed by vivid reproductions of the very rare and invisible old places.

    Korean folk villages on winter weekdays are relatively rare in a quiet atmosphere. Probably because it is cold. As she was discovered that she couldn't be hidden by the crowds, the beautiful scenery in every corner continues. Experience programs can be participated without waiting, and there is no need to hurry and hurry because of the waiting person. It's great to be able to sit around and watch the performances. To enjoy this, it is very helpful to wear warm clothes, attach a hot pack that can be glued close to the exposed area, and prepare warm water in a water bottle.

    It is difficult to describe 'folklore' by pinching it. It is briefly defined as 'a word that encompasses customs, beliefs, skills, and traditions of life related to civil life', but the depth and wide categories contained in it are not simple. It is best to move your body to find out when you do not seem to know the same thing. The Korean Folk Village is a good alternative. A village of about 1 million square meters decorated with folk-related traditional houses, performances, experience programs, exhibits, and marketplaces. This large space is full of folklore.

    He enjoyed a game called kite fights. It is a game of blowing a kite and twisting each other's strings to cut the other's strings or drop the kite. So, I also fed grass with glass powder on the kite line. As I follow the hand that leads the kite making experience, memories of kites come to mind one by one. Shield kite is complete. Hanji is firm, and the flat and curved parts are clean without wrinkles.

    Don't miss the 'twinning the straw' experience. In early winter, farmers gathered and brooded the young. At the end of the harvest, he gathered the remaining rice straw and made a new one to replace the old sandals, yolks, and cords, and prepared for the New Year in advance. Farmer's wisdom is not unreasonable.

    "Don't die!" After hitting the top with the line that the arm fell, it felt like I was burning white. Children seem to be playing with a horn on their tops these days. The experience of making a handcraft while showing the traditional shape of the top will be a pleasant memory for both children and adults. In addition, there is also a 'Ondolbang Experience' where you can learn how to make a traditional ritual using Yeopjeon and Hanji, and learn the principles of Ondolbang by burning the fire yourself.

    The reason why the traditional play experience is felt is the traditional house. There are about 270 houses in the folk village, and local and private houses and Yangban houses are located everywhere. Let's learn what the characteristics of each house are and learn the individuality. Each feature will be seen in the room where the yard lived in the Toho house, the entrance to the house of the person in the rice field, the barn of a local farmhouse, and the chimney of a mountainous farmhouse. We recommend that you stop by and take warm memories while visiting.

    The roof rose from a house. "I'll give you a bird," the roof on which my teeth were picked up when I was young. Children living in apartments do not know, and these customs are displayed in the traditional folk museum. Is this folklore only in Korea? At the World Folk Museum, folk heritage is collected and displayed in various countries.

   It is best to see Nongaknori performance in the field. Impressed by television is less than half the scene. You lift your body and turn your hair and feel the wind pushed by the gesture. In the meantime, the percussion instruments and the shadow of the percussion band are busy. The child who was watching the show jumps in succession.

   The National Intangible Cultural Heritage No. 58 'Tightrope' is also a specialty of the Korean Folk Village. In the old days, it was a precious performance that was only seen in crowded places during the holidays. The dexter on the line was called 'Zulkwangdae' and is an old culture that has been passed down since the Three Kingdoms period. In winter, the snow melted on the strings, making them slippery, and I was worried that my hands and feet would freeze in the cold of the river, but I was worried about the delicate balance. Besides, it's fun to talk over the line and spit it out.
