   Delicacy food sashimi to overcome the summer heat. If you add fresh seasonings and seasonal vegetables to a fresh taste, and then fill it with cool ice water, you are not afraid of the heat of the sun. If you chose Jeju as your vacation destination this summer, don't miss the local specialty, water sashimi. There is also fun to choose and eat according to your taste.

   In summer, Jeju is the best!
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Looking at the dictionary meaning of water sashimi, 'freshly picked fish or squid into pieces finely' is 'food that is mixed with seasoning such as green onion, garlic, and red pepper and poured with water'. It is a food developed usually in the sea, and is commonly found in Jeju and other coastal areas such as Pohang and Sokcho.
   <br/>
   In particular, in Jeju, where the slope is surrounded by the sea, water sashimi was a wise recipe to eat fish or seafood, the main ingredients, even in summer. The main condiments of water, garlic, vinegar, and peeled leaves, have sterilizing effects, and have improved the preservation of ingredients, and the sour sauce with vinegar also played a role in regaining the lost taste in the heat. This is the reason why water inevitably developed in Jeju. Even now, in Jeju, any restaurant or water sashimi is the most popular in summer.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Traditional Jeju water sashimi has a sour taste using fresh leg vinegar made by fermenting raw miso and barley rice in a fresh taste. Add garlic, green pepper, and cuticle leaves, chopped to taste, to taste. If you are unfamiliar with Jeju-style indigenous sauce, this traditional style of water may feel a bit greasy. Moreover, because of the popularity of land-style water soybean paste made with red pepper paste, it is more popular in Jeju today than in traditional methods.

   The first fish that comes to mind when you are in Jeju water is the spot dome. In Jeju, it is not an exaggeration to say that the seating party represents all meetings. It is consumed a lot and caught a lot.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The zodiac, commonly called ‘Zari’, lives a lot on the coast of coral reefs and is the most caught in Jeju. It is the season from May to August when summer begins, so it is a perfect time to go to the water sashimi. Overall, the dark blue spot dome is bigger than the palm of an adult, but uses only small fingers for water use.

  <div class="txt_p">
   The core of the seating session is to remove the head and fin intestines of the seating dome and cut it into bones. Slice the trimmed body diagonally and sprinkle a little bit of vinegar to get a more sour taste. Then, let's pour cold water after seasoning it with seasoned vegetables such as lettuce, cucumber, and sesame leaves. Don't be surprised if you eat without mind, sometimes the tail is chewed whole. The spot dome has a bit of thorn, but the more you chew it, the more you can feel the savory taste. In Jeju, the seated bream is often eaten with grilled or salted fish.

   Hanchi can be tasted not only in summer, but also in the four seasons, as the taste does not change significantly even when stored frozen. However, it is made from creatures caught in season. At the end of June, from the end of June to September, the Hanchi is a fertile fishing boat with brightly lit fishing boats.

   After peeling off the intestine and the skin of the hanchimulhoe, cut it into thin slices and pour cold water with vegetables and seasoning like a dome. The texture of the soft and chewy vegetables and the crunchy vegetables combined together make the texture very satisfying. In addition, the sour soup regains the taste that was lost in the heat. If you're walking on a trail in the sun, order water to float on ice. Cool the body and mind full of heat at once.

   Origin of zodiac, Bomok Port and Mosulpo

  <div class="txt_p">
   Jwamulmul and Hanchimulhoe are popular summer menus, and if you're looking for a restaurant that serves sushi or fish dishes, you can easily find these two menus. Among them, there are many rumored houses that are good at spots near Bomok Port and Mosulpo, where the spots are located. The Eui Ine Sashimi Restaurant, near Bomok Port in Seogwipo, is always a munjeonseong city, not only by locals, but also by word-of-mouth tourists.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Sashimi, of course, has a variety of menus, including various stews and grills, but the best one is sashimi. Bone-spooned sea bream, cucumber, lettuce, and sesame leaves are served with plenty of vegetables. When you eat sesame oil and pour air in a savory water bowl, there is no shortage for a meal. The secret to the taste of this house is above all the fresh ingredients. Since it is a restaurant operated by the captain himself, a spot dome that was raised on that day comes to the table. It is a pity on a day when the boat cannot rise due to bad weather because it makes water sashimi from freshly caught Dome every day, but it cannot be tasted. In this case, the menu is quickly rotated. Although it is a chicken instead of a pheasant, it also boasts a taste that raises your thumb.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Although it is not enough to catch up with the popularity of Saridom and Hanchi, there are also some houses that offer conch water. This is a special dish, as it is raw raw sea urchin with paulownia meat and poured with water and seasoned with vegetables. The texture of the crunchy turban is also pleasant, and the scent of the sea that spreads through your mouth keeps raising the spoon.

   The fishfish are a lot of surprises and fish caught in Jeju and are slightly reddish. The flesh is hard and has a clean and light taste and is often used as water. Compared to seat dome or hanchi, it is treated as an advanced menu. The famous local produce restaurant in downtown Jeju is located in Pyeongdae Haenyeo Village, which is located on the beach, where you can enjoy the sweet and sour fish sashimi that has been poured into the sauce.

There are various abalone menus, but abalone sashimi is popular in summer. Even those who cannot eat abalone can easily enjoy abalone sashimi. Along with the savory miso flavor, the fragrant smell of the fresh abalone excites the lost appetite.
