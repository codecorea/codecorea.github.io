   Bang Tae-san is a natural beauty when hit by humans. Often, when you meet a beauty, you can't even know 'wow' and admiration comes out. This is the case with Bang Tae-san.

   The road to see the beauty is long and rough. After exiting the expressway from Donghongcheon IC, the remaining distance for navigation is 61km. The vagueness that there is a place where you have to run an hour and a half after getting off the expressway in the times when the highway stretches up and down for a while, grabs the handle and enjoys the excitement toward the back country. The closer you get to Mt. Taetae, the farther it is from the expressway. On the side of the winding road, the descending river and Bangdong Valley spread out the pristine landscape. While immersed in the scenery, we arrive at Bangtaesan Natural Recreation Forest ticket office without any boredom.

In front of the stage is a crowd of clouds. He constantly presses the camera shutter toward the main character who unfolds a white thread in heresy.

   Go a little further past the campsite from heresy falls to the forest exploration trail. The Forest Experience Trail, which starts from the parking lot above the 2nd Campsite, is a promenade that allows you to appreciate the unexplored mountains of Bangtae Mountain. It's only 2km away, so a slow pace of 1 hour is enough. But it's not just an hour. It is an hour to admire interjection all along the walk.

   Holy Land of Camping in Autumn
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   For those who enjoy camping, spending a night at Bangtaesan Natural Recreation Forest with beautiful autumn leaves is a wish that you want to achieve once. The campsite sits in a maple forest next to the valley, so where is the better place? It is the land of Bae-pung-byeong, which is comparable to the name of Baesan-byeong. When you open the tent door, clear water flows through the pristine valley, and as you look up, the forest of burning autumn leaves spreads out.

   The camping site is divided into the first camping site across from the resort and the second camping site past the two-stage waterfall. There are a total of 50 decks, 10 at the 1st campsite and 40 at the 2nd campsite. The first campsite is better for relatively quiet camping. The second campsite is close to the two-tier waterfall and forest trail, which is good for walking around the autumn leaves.

   The deck size is relatively small, 3.6m × 3.7m and 3.6m × 3.0m, so minimalist camping is suitable. There are three bathrooms and two kitchens, and one shower room is located at the second campsite. You can't park your car right next to the tent, but it's relatively close, so it's a good idea for auto camping. It is a pity that there is no hot water and electric facilities, but as it is a camping nearer to nature, it lasts for a long time. Warm sleeping bags are essential at this time of year when the temperature drops sharply.

   If you had a honey-like night at Bangtaesan Recreation Forest, it's time to take a tour of the attractions of Inje. First of all, it is 5 minutes away. Because of its high carbonate content, sugar is famous for its delicious cider. Bear Beard, famous for its wildflowers, is 40 minutes away and Park In-hwan Literature Museum is an hour away. You can not miss the one-handed birch forest. The birch grove, called “Aristocracy of the Forest,” is an exotic landscape where visitors from all seasons line up.
