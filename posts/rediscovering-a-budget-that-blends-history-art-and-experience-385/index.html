   Thanks to the reputation of Deoksan Onsen, which has been passed down since the Joseon Dynasty, it is the first budget known as a resort, but there are also various historical sites, as well as spaces where you can enjoy rich artistic sensibility and unique experiences. In particular, you can meet traces of characters familiar to us, such as Chusa Kim Jeong-hee and Mae Heon Yun Bong-gil, so it is also good for families as well as seniors and grandchildren who have had summer vacation.
