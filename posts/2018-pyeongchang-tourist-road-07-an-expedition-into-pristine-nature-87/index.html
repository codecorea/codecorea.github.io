   The journey to meet primitive nature runs from Dongtan to Pyeongchang-gun from Mitan-myeon, Pyeongchang-gun, which is also considered a remote place in Gangwon-do. The enormous nature created by nature and refined by time impresses us infinitely. The wonders felt in Baekryong Cave, and the achievements of tasting through rough waters in the Donggang, are all gifts from nature. Many stars, filled with the night sky as if it's going to pour, give a little bit of excitement and present a precious time to look back on themselves.

   Mittan-myeon, Pyeongchang-gun is one of the most remote areas in Gangwon-do There is a village where you can meet 20 minutes by car. The name is also a beautiful village. Pyeongchang-dong River Freshwater Fish Ecological Center is located at the beginning of Eulchi village, which is famous for ecotourism. When you enter the ecological hall, a cave model that is modeled after Baekryong Cave welcomes travelers. It is a space where you can meet the contents of the White Dragon Cave through sound and visual exhibits.
   <br/>
   The Freshwater Fish Nature Museum, which exhibits freshwater fish in the East River, is the core space of the Pyeongchang-dong Freshwater Fish Ecological Center. There are 46 kinds of freshwater fish such as eojichi, oxeye and gorge. The catfish, which hides a huge body of 1.2m in the gap between the rocks, is a place for freshwater fish.

   If the exhibition hall on the first floor is a viewing space, the second floor exhibition hall consisting of a fish exploration hall and a Donggang experience hall is a space for experience. Watching the live-action video on the big screen, the rafting experience over the rugged waters of the river is as thrilling as riding a roller coaster. You can catch fish with your bare hands at the outdoor experience hall connected to the exhibition hall on the second floor. After looking around the ecology hall, you can try various sports such as rafting, kayaking, skyline, sky jumping, etc.

   White Dragon Cave (Natural Monument No. 260) was opened to the public as it was designated as an ecological learning cave in 2010. It has been 30 years since it was known to the world by villagers in 1976. Baekryong Cave has become the representative ecotourism destination of Pyeongchang, which is visited by 10,000 people every year within 6 years of cave opening.

   Baekryong Cave visit begins with a change of clothes. If you bring your helmet, head lantern, gloves and boots, you're ready to visit. The reason why you need a visitor's suit is found in the cave. Go to the cave entrance by boat. The distance that once had to walk 40 minutes along the iron railings has been reduced to 10 minutes. The huge rock that meets the cave entrance is Ondol. Even after more than 1700 years, there are still traces of fire burned in the firewood under the ondol.

   The trail is rougher than I thought. In a lightless cave, the head lantern on the helmet is the only guide. Narrow trails are also embarrassing. Hitting the head against the ceiling because the sight of the helmet is obscured, there are several sections where you can keep walking by bending your waist 90 degrees to the suddenly lowered ceiling.

   Only after exploring more than exploration did the white dragon cave reveal its deep inside. Stylized stalactites suspended from the ceiling like icicles, staggering towering stalagmites, and giant stalagmites where stalactites and stalagmites meet. The strange shape of the cave retains its original beauty. Pride egg-shaped stalagmite, which can be used as a camera lens if processed well, is the best among them. When you reach the end of the cave, you'll be able to turn off all the lights and have a special experience facing the dark.

   If you follow the Donggang River from Baekyong Cave, it leads to Yeongwol. In summer, Donggang is a rafting paradise. The representative rafting course is 12km from Munsan Naruter to Subsenaruter. It is the best course where you can enjoy thrill and pleasure at the same time as the rapids and the smooth water are mixed. Good luck in facing hidden secrets of Donggang, including Eorayeon, is a bonus. Eorayeon, one of Yeongwol 8 sights, is also the 14th scenic spot.

   The start of rafting is safety education. Over 30 minutes, you will learn how to use your paddle and learn how to handle emergencies. It is also important to get acquainted with water. 'Unification of spirit' 'We are one' is the best way to get acquainted with water to remind us of military training. Both the security guards who give up the spirit and the experienced visitors who receive the spirit are both happy and playful. One person is aboard the boat in response to the safety signals. The front of the boat is the strongest member of the team, and the back is the safety guard.

Donggang Falls, as its name suggests, is a special event that jumps from boat to Donggang. If you dare to throw a boat or a river from the rock, the summer heat is already receding.

   Once you enter Yeongwol along the Donggang River, it is time to finish the day. There is no place like Yeongwol Byeolcho Observatory to organize a day spent in nature. It is the third oldest observatory in our country, equipped with an observation room, an auxiliary observation room, and an astronomical projection room. Astro observation is divided into day observation and night observation. Observing sunspots and redness of the sun during the day and the moon at night. Astrophysical observations follow the observation of the sun, moon and planets in the secondary observation room, followed by observations of nebulae and galaxies. The assistant observation room of Byeolmaro Astronomical Observatory is the best observatory that can not only observe the celestial bodies but also the city of Yeongwol and Donggang at a glance.

   Solar observations use astronomical telescopes equipped with special filters and round iron plates looking at sunspots. Observation of the sun's redness through the telescope's finder and the sunspots attached are identified by images on a round iron plate. It is surprising that sunspots that are smaller than the clear dust on the iron plate are many times larger than the earth. The most common thing in night observations is the moon. Depending on the atmosphere, planets like Jupiter can be observed, but there are not many opportunities.

How to find the North Star by the location of the Big Dipper is a bonus.
   <br/>
   In the VR experience room on the 2nd floor of the observatory, you can experience the exhilarating experience as if you are actually paragliding through realistic VR images. In Byeolmaro Astronomical Observatory, two teams conduct astronomical observation five times a day from 3:30 pm to 30 minutes.
