   Since ancient times, the place where there is water has always been a place of people's living. Even now, prehistoric people who lived and settled in have chosen a place with water to live. The prehistoric ruins of Jodong-ri, located in Dongyang-myeon, Chungju-si, are large village ruins from the Neolithic Age to the Bronze Age, based on the Namhan River. The large river called Namhan River and the alluvial plains created by the flooding were suitable for people to live. Prehistoric ruins date back to approximately 7000 years. Since the Neolithic began to live for the first time, the Bronze activists continued their agricultural life 3000 years ago.

   The prehistoric ruins of Jo Dong-ri became known to the world as the ruins were exposed in 1990 due to heavy rain. Over the next ten years, some of the ruins of the Neolithic era, as well as the ruins of the Bronze Age, as well as the burning seats and huts were excavated. The ruins reveal that prehistoric people lived on a large scale in villages and active farming.

   Jodong-ri Agricultural Room on the 2nd floor of the museum is a place where you can examine the use of agricultural artifacts discovered in Jodong-ri and the grains of the time. You can see the picture of the moisturizer used to plow the ground, the vandal knife and scythe used to cut the grain, and the use of the reeds and reed used to peel the fruit or grind grain. Among them, care was not only used to plow the land, but also a multifunctional tool that played a role as a shovel and a hoe. Wouldn't it be MacGyver knife these days? In the ruins of Jo Dong-ri, various traces of grain were excavated. Wheat was the largest with 723 eggs, and barley and rice, rice, rice, and park and peach seeds were also found. Most of them are carbonized, but it's easy to see the grain from 3000 years ago.

   Next to the farm room is a place in commemoration of Dr. Huh Mun-hui, a farmer from Chungju. Dr. Huh, who has made great contributions to Korean agricultural history, has developed a unified rice that opened the rice self-sufficiency era. In Korea, there were four springs, often called “barley hills,” until the 1970s. It was a country that mainly produces rice, but most people did not have a warm meal.

   Unification rice is a hybrid of Japanese and Taiwanese rice varieties, and is a cultivar developed by three-way breeding of IR8, which was nurtured by the International Rice Research Institute. Rice grown in Korea was weak against wind and pests, and the yield was very low a year. Since the unification of rice since 1972, rice self-sufficiency rate has surpassed 100% with increasing production.
