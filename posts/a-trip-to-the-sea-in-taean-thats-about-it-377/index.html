   The West Sea is full of things that 'Donghae' does not have. The arithmetic depth does not match the East Sea, but it is deeper than any deep sea when approaching the chest. Not the hot and energetic sunrise of the East Sea, but the relaxing and calm afternoon colors, and the scenery like relaxation at sunset at dusk. . Unlike the rough and cool East Sea, the West Sea is full of calmness and calmness, and the West Sea is filled with the smell of the depths of our lives.
   <br/>
   Taean, which has been known as a peaceful and comfortable town since ancient times, is a representative tourist spot on the west coast that retains the beauty of the west sea. The wonderful beach path spreads casually, and you can enjoy the spectacular sunset from anywhere. The picturesque scenery that unfolds with numerous islands in harmony shows why this is Taeanhaean National Park.

   Manripo Beach's 'Honam Sashimi House' operates a fish market, and it serves as a selection of all kinds of fresh seafood from the West Sea, including various types of sashimi and tang, as well as grilled and stewed, stew, yellow haejangguk, and clam noodles. There is no chin on the door, so it is good to go in and out of a wheelchair. After parking next to the building, you need an assistant to enter the restaurant.
