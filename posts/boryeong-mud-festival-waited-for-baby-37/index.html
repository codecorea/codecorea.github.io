   One of the first exciting festivals in summer! Boryeong Mud Festival at Boryeong Daecheon Beach in Chungnam, South Korea will be held from the 15th to the 24th. Let's go to a young and energetic festival. If you enjoy the festival, mud packs that naturally fall on your body is a bonus.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Boryeong Mud Festival no longer needs explanation. Younger people as well as family units with young children, and this year, even the elderly and seniors who came to hear the rumors have expanded. Let's take a look at Daecheon Beach where the Mud Festival is held around the popular Mud Experience Center (paid zone).

    Let's look at the transportation first. Boryeong Mud Festival is not difficult to find by public transport. If you're not good at driving, or if you're a lover, don't have a car. If you are a novice driver and want to go to the festival on weekends, you should park your car far away or use public transportation.

    Daecheon Station and Boryeong Bus Terminal are located in front of you, and it is only 10 minutes from Daecheon Beach where Boryeong Mud Festival is held. It means you can reach the festival as much as you like. One night and two days is enough to enjoy the mud festival. (This is based on a person with average fitness in their early to mid 30's.) If you're looking for a mud festival for a family summer vacation, you can afford this hot summer vacation, but you can't work properly like a cow. We recommend a salty one-night two-day course after work.

    Once the hostel is caught in Wuchang. During the festival, the price of accommodation in Daecheon Beach is soaring. 2.5 to 3 times the low season. If you're bothered to come and go, and you have a lot of room to pay, you can find a place to stay in front of the festival. But if you don't want to be noisy and crowded (Jeju loves Korean tourists' love of Korean sake all night long), Muchangpo is a 15-minute drive from Daecheon Beach. Accommodation is stable and much quieter. In addition, Muchangpo Beach is beautiful. It is not too much to enjoy tidal-flat experience with children, and if you are lovers, it is also a good date course. If you want to whisper something sweet, everyone recommends a relatively quiet ritual rather than passionate, youthful Daecheon.

   Oh, since the Boryeong Mud Festival holds a photo contest every year, you need a sense to cover your face with 'colored body painting'. This is because photographers from all over the country flock. A face that doesn't know where it was taken could be used as an image to promote the Mud Festival next year. Expose your body and cover your face. This is a fun way to enjoy the mud festival.

   The next finish of the mud pack is the sea bathing
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    If your whole body is full of mud, and you have enjoyed the mud experience to the fullest, let's run to Daecheon. It's time to enjoy swimming. Wipe the mud with the streams throughout the festival, enjoy the sea bathing, and go to the shower. Don't worry if you don't have a car or accommodation. There is a locker and a paid shower in the festival. Cards, mobile phones and cameras move in waterproof packs. Even if you do not prepare in advance, you can easily get it at the convenience store. Just wear a waterproof pack. However, care should be taken with UV protection. Sunglasses can be broken at the mud experience, so it's a good idea to have a cap that fits your head. The mud also blocks UV rays, making it a stone. A chill in midsummer will wash the mud-washed head out of the cold shower.

  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    If you enjoyed the mud experience enough, now you can do what you like. You can also enjoy painting and swimming. There is also a booth for making mud soap. Games on the tidal flats, short marathon competitions and beach futsal competitions are also held. If the time is right, enjoy anything. Why don't you fill it up with a variety of stuffed foods all over the festival grounds and run until you get back to reality.

    Finally, one tip to enjoy the Boryeong Mud Festival. Get some earplugs. Because our cochlea is precious. One more thing to add to the old lady is to wear a bathing suit. It's free to wear what kind of coat on it! Regular underwear can't stop the mud. You will also need a waterproof pack that will hold the car key, card, and cell phone mentioned earlier.
