    Around Incheon Station and Dong-Incheon Station (National Railway Line 1), that is, Jung-gu, where Chinatown and Sinpo International Market are located, has long been the center of Incheon. In the mid-1980s, as the Incheon City Hall moved to Namdong-gu, it was difficult to find the same vitality as it moved to Sanggwon-do. It is a special place that buried memories and longing.

   Opened in 1966 and opened for generations, Myeongwoljip is a restaurant that has been loved as one and only alum (7,000 won) for over 50 years. Since it is a single menu, there is no need to order separately. If you just sit down and talk to the number of people, bring the dish to the tray after a while. Kimchi, radish greens, mushroom stir-fry, egg roll, tofu stew, and mackerel stew are like eating at home.

   The types of side dishes change little by little, but egg rolls and fish stew are not always missing. Counting, there are nine side dishes except soup. However, the amount is reasonable and the liver is moderate, so there is little left.

   However, the real main character of Myeongwoljip is separate. This is kimchi jjigae, which is boiling all day long on a corner of a restaurant, on a rare oil stove these days. It is a “self” menu that customers eat and eat, but you can refill as many times as you like. A bowl of kimchi stew with plenty of thick pork cuts into it, and the air in the rice is soaking up quickly. You can bring any number of vegetables, such as lettuce, Chinese cabbage, and green pepper, which are always prepared on the shelf next to the stove.

   Myeongwoljip was also named in the “100 Old Korean Restaurants Loved by Koreans” announced by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and the Korean Food Foundation in 2012. Myeongwoljip and Ganghwa-gun's Wooriok were selected side by side as the ‘baekban’. It's a bit awkward to have a new signboard that doesn't have the atmosphere of an old restaurant. Except for the phrase 'Since 1966', which is a small sign at the entrance, there is no element to notice that it is an old restaurant.

   Local food in Incheon, Haejangguk Pyeongyangok
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   In Incheon, there is another restaurant selected as '100 old Korean restaurants that Koreans love.' It is 'Pyongyang Ok', which was opened in 1945 by a senior Kim Seok-ha couple from Sunan, Pyongyang. It belongs to Jung-gu, the same as Myeongwoljip in the administrative district, but if Myeongwoljip is within walking distance from Incheon Station and Chinatown, Pyeongyangok is close to Dowon Station, two stops away from Incheon Station.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The representative menu of Pyongyang Ok is Haejangguk (11,000 won), which is boiled with boiled Chinese cabbage and boiled with miso and boiled cabbage. It is soft and tender with thick broth and soft ribs in clear broth.
   <br/>
   As you know, Incheon was a port for the opening of the Japanese colonial rule, where the goods were common and people gathered a lot. At that time, there were many Haejanggukjips that targeted them in Sinpo-dong and Dap-dong, lined with white banyan houses.

    Haejangguk is the most popular, but galbitang is as good as it is, and you can taste cold noodles and bulgogi. However, you can only order one Haejangguk from 5 am to 11 am. The restaurant building, which was a small hanok, was destroyed by a fire and turned into a two-story building. It is said that many presidents and famous politicians have visited.

   Although it was only known to the outsiders as “Shinpo Market Chicken Gangjeong,” Sinpo-dong is a neighborhood with many friendly pubs where you can lightly drink a glass of soju. Dabokjip, Manyangjip, Yeomyeomjip, Daejeonjip, Popeye ... The name of each other is also pretty. What these pubs have in common is that they are old, that they sell various kinds of wares and sujitang, and that the snack prices are really good.

   Among them, 'Dabokjip', located in the back alley of Sinpo-dong, is a mountain history of Sinpo-dong, where wife and children have been succeeding and succeeding after Han Bok-su, the first president of the company. It is said that literary artists and artists in Incheon went in and out of the threshold. Among them, poet Choi Seung-ryul, who had been active in Incheon for a long time, was the representative. A piece of Choi's face is hanging under the signboard, and there is also a poem in the store. For the first time to visit Dabokjip, the form of the signboard and the typeface and the two-digit phone number are more interesting than the strange story.
