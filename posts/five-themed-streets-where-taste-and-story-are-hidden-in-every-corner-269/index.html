   Go to Tteokbokki Street in Sindang-dong, Seoul
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   No one lives in Seoul and knows the streets of Tteokbokki in Sindang-dong located in Jung-gu.
   <br/>
   As such, Sindang-dong Tteokbokki Street is the holy ground of Tteokbokki with a history of 60 years. There are more than 10 Tteokbokki restaurants lined up in this place, which is the only shop in Korea that specializes in Tteokbokki. According to the native party of Sindang-dong, there were seats made in the briquette oven immediately after the Korean War. In times of need, Tteokbokki became popular as a street food that was able to fill the boat at a low price.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   It was the birthplace of the Yalgae culture and was the birthplace of high school students in the 70's and 80's. It is said that middle-aged students who were still high school students at the time still hold their children's hands.

    Tteokbokki is a genealogical food. From the 1800s onwards, rice cakes and meat, herbs and roasted rice were used as king's statues to become royal rice cakes. After the Korean War, recipes were streamlined and Gochujang changed to today's rice cakes. Recently, ingredients such as ramen, eggs, fried dumplings, and cheese are added to your liking.

   To find the softest and deepest taste in the world, go to Gangneung Chodang Tofu Street

   Today, Chodang, Gangneung-si, is the place where Heo Gyun, author of &lt;Hong Gil-dong&gt; and Henan Seolheon, a female poet lived. As their father, Cho-yeop, lived here, he made tofu using seawater. So, there is a theory that he named 'chodang tofu' after Heo Yeop.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   During the Korean War, men died, and the Anaks, who had a difficult time to eat and live, made tofu and sold them all night to feed and educate their children.
   <br/>
   Now, there are about a dozen tofu houses along the pine forest path that is more than 500 years old, of which there are quite a few families that span two or three generations.

   In Namwon, Jeollabuk-do, the clean streams of the Seomjin River flow and abundant sedimentary layers are formed, so there are many first-class loach, and a natural environment in which greenery such as tarodae and bracken ferns can be easily obtained. This is the background of the birth of Namwon Chueotang.

  <div class="txt_p">
   The method of boiling chueotang differs slightly from province to province, and is divided into Seoul-style boiled loach and Namdo-style boiled. Namwon Chueotang is characterized by eating plenty of Musiraegi, adding miso, perilla, and Janpi powder (Chopi powder) to make it soft and thick.

   In summer, the Anjirang in Daegu, the hottest terrain on the Korean Peninsula, is said to be a place where Daegu residents enjoyed summer resorts due to the dense forest. The place where Gopchang Street is located is Anjirang's former marketplace. It was the beginning of a grandmother to take and sell pork giblets at a slaughterhouse, and as the economy became difficult with the IMF, there were more customers who wanted to eat generous giblets at cheap prices. It has been said that it has become a specialty of Daegu, which has been crowded with college students, family units, and enthusiasts.

  <div class="txt_p">
   It is not known when the giblets began to be eaten, but it is said to be from raising livestock worldwide. In Donguibogam, it is said that ‘Giblet enhances energy and energy and strengthens the spleen and stomach.’ It is a high-protein food that is popular for diet and beauty.
