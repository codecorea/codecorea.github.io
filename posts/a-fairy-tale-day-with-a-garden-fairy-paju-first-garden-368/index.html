   It was a city life that seemed to have driven only shallow breaths due to the continuous fine dust warning. As soon as you pass the ticket office, you breathe down into the spacious lawn park. Instead of the center where the colored flowers are planted, they move into a quiet forest. From the Tuscan fountain to the right, from the oak and cherry forest forests to the butterfly gardens where butterflies come from, to the white and mysterious white garden. Twenty-three gardens decorated with each concept create a different atmosphere.

   When you walk through the alleys of a quiet forest and a small garden, you can see the face flowers that barely crossed your knees and knees. Holding a pair of ferns and ferns, and stretching fingers with the other hand, “Teacher, what is this?” A tumultuous flower that chatters without rest. First Garden is especially visited by children.

   This is because there are various amusement facilities including various gardens as well as an inori with playground equipment such as a carousel and a viking, a thrilling four-sled sledding range, and a challenge to jump over and balance and climb a lot. If you go around the Inori on a small train, you will be a friend who greets you with your neck and bows in the window. At Hesseng Cultural Center, there is an experience program that allows you to create your own art objects from plants such as wood crafts and plant crafts, so parents with children can spend a day with a good crossing between Ainori and Hessett.

   First Garden is a great destination for couples who want to get the right “life shot” in a romantic atmosphere. The embroidered flowerbed that takes a picture of the Zeus water fountain behind has a European atmosphere with statues of gods from Roman mythology such as Bacchus and Mars. This is a regular photo zone for prospective newlyweds who visit for self-wedding snapshots. If you want to take pictures of tropical forests, visit Green House. It presents a fairy-tale scenery that is so charming that the spirit of the forest pops out even soon. Bird Plaza, located at the edge of the Green House, has cute crosshairs and parrots waiting for tourists. Cross-sister is a name given to mean that if you put 10 birds, you will behave like a sister. If you put a little bit on your palm and wait a few seconds, it will come and tickle your palm.
