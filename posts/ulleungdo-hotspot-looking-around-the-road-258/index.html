    Ulleungdo is not an easy to find destination. Thanks to this, there are those who prepare as carefully as they find it because they are shy and different. Group products for travel agencies are inexpensive, and single trips can be moved according to your preferences. Introducing the hot spots on Ulleungdo's roundabout road, which is a must-see during the visit to Ulleungdo. Coastal drive, an excitement of the island trip, is a bonus.

    In an accurate sense, Ulleungdo's Round Road is not yet a round road. This is because it is not possible to operate a vehicle in the section of about 4.7km from Naesujeon to Seokpo (seommok). The section we call ‘Ulleungdo Iljudo’ refers to the pavement from Naesujeon ~ Dodong ~ Jedong ~ Namyang ~ Taeha ~ Hyeonpo ~ Cheonbu ~ Seommok except Naesujeon ~ Sukpo. It's not a complete round circle, but it's not awkward because it's a road connecting all of Ulleungdo's coastline except for the unopened section. Let's know though. In 2013, it is said that it is impossible to drive around the road along the “Ulleungdo Island Round Road”.

    First of all, the starting point was set at Jeodong and Dodong ports, Ulleungdo's entry port. From Ulleungdo, I plan to depart from Naesujeon and run clockwise to Seokpo (seommok). Of course, you can move in reverse. Let's take a look at the domestic observation deck, which is considered the sunrise point. The Naesujeon Observatory, which touches the Naesujeon ~ Sokpo Old Road, is only a 15-minute walk from the steep stairs and uphill. The slight strain on the joints disappears as the snow melts in the cool spread. Jeodong Port and Jukdo Island at a glance greet people. Even if you haven't set the sunrise time, don't miss it.

It is not boring to see and see the squid harbok work of Ulleungdo ajimae. You can taste fresh seafood in the sea breeze with a sea breeze.

   When squid is a boiled fish, it is sold at around 5000 won per head, and when it comes back, about 20,000 won (3 heads) per dish. If it is not packaged, it costs about 9,000 won including a bottle of soju. It is full of fresh sashimi including horns, sea squirts, and dongs. The spicy spicy soup is also popular among lovers. The Jeodong Port Passenger Terminal has ships to and from Gangneung, Gangneung and Dokdo. It is better to avoid ship time because it has a lot of floating population after Dodong Port.

   The coastal road next to the candlestick rock of Jeodong Port leads to Dodong Port. The coastal road with strong snow is a path that can be walked without difficulty by all ages. However, if part of the section is under construction, you can't look back at once, but you have to walk a little from Jeodong Port and a little from Dodong Port. If it is possible to complete, it does not matter where you start.

   Dodong Port, where boats depart from Mukho, is the busiest space on Ulleungdo. It is a lodging facility, and most of the convenience facilities are gathered from restaurants, convenience stores, banks, and PC rooms. Behind the newly renovated Dodong Passenger Terminal is a coastal walkway that leads to Jeodong Port. The view from the Haengnam Lighthouse is a point that cannot be missed. Around Dodong Port, there are restaurants where you can taste mulleap, barnacle rice, and squid intestines, which are delicacies of Ulleungdo. It is better to taste the above delicacies when traveling on this section. If you go further south from Dodong Port, you will reach Sadong Port (Ulleung New Port). There are ships to and from Dokdo, as well as passenger ships to and from 뭍.

    After passing through Tongmi, you reach Namyang Port. Is it because it is located in the southwest of Ulleungdo? It has a southwest sunset observatory. The construction of Namyang New Port is in full swing. Here, 'Ulleung Pharmacy Specialty Store', a specialty of Ulleungdo, is gathered. &lt;Solar Restaurant&gt;, which is considered to be a barnacle restaurant, is also located here. In addition to restaurants, there are some amenities such as &lt;Namyang Nonghyup&gt; and &lt;Daegu Bed &amp; Breakfast&gt;. If you don't like the bustling Dodong Port or Jeodong Port, it's okay to get a lodging here.

    From Namyang to Taeha, located on the northwestern tip of Ulleungdo, it runs for a month. It is an indispensable space in the history of Ulleungdo, bearing the Taeha Coastal Road, which is regarded as a double-headed carriage of the Ulleungdo Coastal Trail along with the Haengnam Trail. In July 1883, the following year, when the pioneering order of Ulleungdo was issued as the capital of the old Usan Island, Taeha, the land of Ulleungdo closest to the Korean Peninsula, 54 pioneers took their first steps here. Before being moved to Dodong in 1907, Taeha was the administrative center of Ulleungdo for over 20 years. Let's stop by Seongsindang, located in front of the Taeha branch of Namyang Elementary School, and listen to the sad legend of the Southeastern sister born by Taeha.

    It dates back to 1417 (17th year of King Taejong). Appointed as a choreographer on Ulleungdo, In-woo Kim arrives here on a mission to move Ulleungdo residents to land. The day before leaving with the villagers, a sea god appears in a dream and asks to leave a pair of Southeast Asians on the island. Ignoring this, I tried to depart, but when the waves were so severe that I could not leave the island, he left with two false children on the island. After returning to Ulleungdo eight years later, Inwoo Kim finds the children's white bones and builds a small shrine to comfort them. It is a legend embraced by the Holy Ghost.

    The 200-year-old highway policy at the expense of young children led to General An Yong-bok's talks about Dokdo, and their ambition toward Dokdo remains in the 21st century. Once you've looked at Seongshindang, take the monorail to Taeha Lighthouse. You can go up on foot, but remember that even if you get off the monorail, you have to climb the dirt road for about 10 minutes. Next to the Taeha Lighthouse, there is an observatory of great wind. The sense of great wind that refers to the perforated rock means 'a place waiting for the strong wind'.

    Ulleungdo, famous for its juniper trees, is a good place to build a boat, so many people came to the old boat to build a new boat. When the new ship was completed, it was a place to wait for the strong wind blowing in the direction of the mainland by attaching sails and anchor lines in the rock holes. When the wind blows, it breaks the anchor and goes to the land in a month. At the observation deck, squids are relaxingly shooting the sea breeze. Squid, which is considered to be delicious on Ulleungdo Island, is probably due to the wind here. If you saw the great view of the viewpoints that photographers and travelers say are beautiful, don't miss the ocher cave at the beginning of the Taeha Trail. Choreographers dispatched to Ulleungdo, who had to run on the rugged sea path, had to prove their granularity by taking ocher and juniper trees from this island.

After passing the Hyeonpo Observatory, where you see the Hyeonpo Village at a glance, greet the senior citizens and reach the heavens.

    If you travel to Ulleungdo by public transportation, you should be aware of the Cheonbu Station. Just remember it as a transfer stop. The road from Seokpo, which is considered as an outback in Ulleungdo, to Ismok is steep and winding. The front of An Yong-bok Memorial Hall is the best point to see Jukdo Island. You can go to the An Yong Bok Memorial Hall by car. Before going to the memorial, it's okay to run along the coast to Gwaneumdo, the last point of the current coastal road. Gwaneumdo Island, where Yeondogyo Bridge is located, is emerging as a new destination for Ulleungdo Island.

Until the pavement road is formed between Seokpo and Naesujeon, the only way to connect the two is to walk through the old road or use the island mok ferry. To return to Naesunjeon by car, you have to go back to the round road or use the island mok ferry (054-791-9905). However, ferry operation in winter should be confirmed in advance.
