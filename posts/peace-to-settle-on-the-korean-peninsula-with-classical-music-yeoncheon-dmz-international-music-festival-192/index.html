<title>Peace to settle on the Korean Peninsula with classical music, Yeoncheon DMZ International Music Festival - Yeoncheon-gun, Gyeonggi-do, Korea</title>





<meta name="description" content="From July 25th to August 2nd, &#39;Yeoncheon DMZ International Music Festival&#39; will be held in Yeoncheon-gun, Gyeonggi-do for 9 days. The main stage of the festival is the Jeokgok-ri Seonje Historic Site, Hantan River Tourist Site, and Sureul Art Hall. This year, with the theme of “coexistence,” about 40 musicians, including Sook-ryun Park, will produce chords. Orchestra performances, concerts by artists from around the world, fringe concerts, visiting concerts, music academies, and classical lectures are held throughout the music festival. I believe that the feast of beautiful classics created by travelers from Yeoncheon-gun and artists from around the world will greatly contribute to the settlement of peace on the Korean Peninsula.

   The tragedy of the Korean War, which broke out in 1950, ended on July 27, 1953, three years later. That day was the day the Armistice Agreement was signed. The formal name of the Armistice Agreement is the Agreement on the Military Armistice of the Republic of Korea, with the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations as one side and the Supreme Commander of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Commander of the People's Republic of China as the other. On this day, the UN, North Korean and Chinese forces signed the Armistice Agreement under Article 5, Section 63. Korea, a party to the Korean War, was excluded. This ended the war that lasted for three years and a month, but demilitarized zones (DMZs), literally banned areas of armament, formed on the Korean Peninsula.
   <br/>
   According to data from DMZ Museum, the demilitarized zone of the Korean Peninsula is 155 miles (about 248 km) from Gyodongdo Island on the western side of Yeseong River and Hangang River to Panmunjom in the southern part of Kaesong, through Cheorwon and Geumhwa in the central region to Goseong Myeongho (Unification Observatory) on the east coast. ), Which means 2 km between the north and the south, about 300 million pyeong (3,360 km) of the buffering zone, centered on the Military Demarcation Line (MDL). You can see the DMZ from the key observation deck north of Yeoncheon-gun. You must bring your ID to visit the Key Observation Deck.

   It's a place of heartbreaking history, but you can't just stay in the past. Yeoncheon-gun has repeatedly transformed itself into the number one spot in security tourism for peace and reunification, and has been holding the Yeoncheon DMZ International Music Festival since 2011 as one of its new efforts. The DMZ is also the site of the division of the Fatherland, but the festival focuses on classical music every year in the hope of being reborn as a site of reunification, peace, and ecology.

   On the other hand, if you're traveling with elementary school children, check out the Jeokgok Seonsa Museum, located in Jeokgok-ri, the home of the Paleolithic people 350,000 years ago. What is more eye-catching is the model of human ancestors reproduced in vivid form. Tumai, the ancestor of humanity about 7 to 6 million years ago, Australopithecus who lived in eastern and southern Africa 4 to 2 million years ago, Homo erectus that appeared about 1.8 million years ago, appeared in Africa about 200,000 years ago Homo sapiens and others welcome visitors.
   <br/>
   In the cave paintings section, it is interesting to reproduce murals found in Lasco Cave in France and Altamira Cave in Spain. If you go to the outdoor experience center, you will be waiting for the fist ax making experience.
