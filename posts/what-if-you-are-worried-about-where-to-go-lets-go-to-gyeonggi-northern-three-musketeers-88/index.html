   Amazing Park, located at the foot of Suwibong Peak, Pocheon-si, Gyeonggi-do, is a complex cultural space of nature + science + relaxation. It is a science playground where you can see, touch, feel and explore the principles of science. The first welcoming spectator on a winding mountain trail is the `` Suspension Bridge '', which is 130 meters in Nature Zone. This arched wag that connects the forest of healing across the valley offers an experience of walking in the sky.

  <div class="txt_p">
   At Science Zone's Amazing Park Science Museum, students learn science and engineering knowledge by moving around 200 engineering instruments. The Amazing Swing, a large swing that moves between more than 100 streams falling from a height of 4.5 meters, is the most popular item in the museum. It is a ride that can be safely enjoyed by both men and women of all ages.
