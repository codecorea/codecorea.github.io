   The battery is charged when it runs out, and the burned candle is replaced by a new one when worn out. How can a dead person regain energy? Fallen power can be replenished with meals and exercise, but mental exhaustion is not the way to find it. However, if you are in a prison in me, located in Hongcheon, Gangwon-do, you may be able to lift a limp soul.

   The prison head of the prison in me is Kwon Yong-suk, a lawyer from the prosecutor's office. The period behind the creation of a 'prison' that anyone is reluctant to go back to the late 1990s. During the prosecutor's case at Jeju Prosecutor, he worked nearly 100 hours a week, and he needed to recharge both his body and mind. It was prison that caught his eye at that time. His request to spend a week in prison for the prison warden was now the seed of 'the prison within me'.

Instead of rippling streams, you'll be able to jump on ice and, if you're lucky, you'll find elk that's been running through the mountains.

   The room is large enough for five steps for a man and six steps for a woman. In a room that doesn't even fit a single bed, there's a small drawer and desk, a single teapot and an electric pot, and a toilet and a small sink. It may be frustrating, but if you go through it, space is left. Things that seemed inconvenient because of it are rather cumbersome.

   When you enter the room after the group schedule, the visit will be locked outside with 3 kinds and you will start your own time. Before going into a solitary confinement, let's leave the worldly thing as possible for full concentration. The anxiety that arises from the loss of the concept of time is brief. Only the sound of the bells, the bells ringing in time, the rice coming in through the pot, and the relaxed nature of the sun rises and falls.

   The programs that make the most use of training centers are short-term programs for homeless people and non-communities. A non-communist means a monk, who is a monk and a monk who concentrates on the topic for several years in a solitary cell. It starts at 108 times every day for seven nights and eight days, and during the morning, he frees his head while listening to the Kumgang monk's broadcast lecture, which releases the public commentary `` Munjikan ''. In the afternoon, only beginners will be interviewed with beginner lectures. If you are not willing to attend, you can immerse yourself in a 1.5-pyeong single room for seven nights and eight days. Your day will be an unfamiliar experience that no one disturbs.
