    Even if the water path is tightly frozen, the warmth of calm emotion is transmitted. Road 337, which runs along Bunwon-ri and Gyeongancheon, is a path that blends history, exhibitions, and walking spaces in history. Namhan River, Paldang Lake and the clean path leading to the exhibition halls, old kilns and ecological parks await.

  <div class="txt_p">
   The corner towns where Gyeongancheon and Namhan River meet are separated from the world for a moment. There are no boats and people on the water that has become a water resource protection area, and the local road No. 337 that bypasses to Yangpyeong is even the best.
   <br/>
   When you pass the Toechon Intersection along the path that crosses the Gyeongancheon River, the Gyeongancheon Wetland Ecological Park reveals a calm look. The wetland ecological park, belonging to the eight views of Gwangju, has a different winter walk. The white trail connecting the riverside and the wetland extends for about 2km. There are friendly guides to the flora and fauna inhabiting the ecological park. Gyeongancheon River, where you can meet elk and migratory birds, is also the wintering place of Koni. The riverside leading to the bird's eye view is also popular for family walks and dating dates for lovers. There are shelter everywhere, helping to remember the winter.

   As you enter Namwon-myeon Bundwon-ri, downstream of Gyeongancheon, time flows slowly. Although the surrounding villages are quiet, the spirits contained in them are high-class. Bunwon-ri is where the last kiln of the Joseon Dynasty was located. The village name 'Bunwon-ri' is also named after the white porcelain branch of Saongwon, which was responsible for the food of the court. Good clay and firewood were needed to bake a bowl used in the palace, and an old kiln was created where the river stem meets the Han River.

   In terms of scale, even if it lags behind Gwangju Ceramic Museum in Gwangju, it is still different from the story. Located on a hill behind a secluded village, the museum remodeled the school and raised the building. It is a warm consideration not to damage the white porcelain that was buried in the elementary school site. The Japanese Imperial High School was established at the place where the royal bowl was to be cooked, and the site was revealed through excavation work in the early 2000s. The refurbished museum is strongly surrounded by iron plates.

   On the way to the museum, the names of the discovered whites are engraved, and the selection fees of Saongwon are lined up side by side. Inside the museum, white porcelain from the time of excavation is displayed. In the museum, you can decorate a postcard by stamping it, and if you make a reservation in advance, you can experience making a bowl yourself. It is a small space, but the friendly atmosphere with commentary is also friendly.
   <br/>
   The winter scenery overlooking the front of the museum is as elegant as white porcelain. Gyeongancheon and Paldang Lake blend smoothly over a large tree. The Bunwon White porcelain museum is free of charge, all year round.

    In Bunwon-ri, a unique museum attracts attention. The face museum behind Namjongmyeon Office (031-765-3522,

    ) Is a space where dolls, masks, etc. from around the world are exhibited using faces. Founded by a theater director, this museum decorates the courtyard with hanok and stone statues in Namdo, and has a shelter for a cup of tea. The Face Museum will be closed until February 12th to replace the exhibits and will be reopened from the 13th. Mondays and Tuesdays are closed, and Wednesdays and Thursdays must be reserved in advance to enter. It is always open from Friday to Sunday.

   The quiet exhibition halls continue along the waterways. To get a good view of Paldang Lake, which is in contact with Gyeongancheon, we will go to the Water Environment Exhibition Hall (031-8008-6937). On the 9th floor of the renovated building, there is an exhibition hall overlooking the Paldang Lake. On the other hand, when you look at the observation deck on the other hand, you can see the beautiful views of Paldang from Sonae Island, Yogja Island, and Yebongsan Mountain without interruption. A telescope is also provided so you can closely observe traces on the river that are easy to miss on the ground. From the past of Paldang Lake, it has been decorated as a scientific experience space where you can feel the preciousness of plants and animals and water.

   In the vicinity of Gyeongancheon, there is also a meaningful space where you can calmly organize your excursion. This is the nest and history of Japanese women's comfort women who entered Wondang-ri. Here, the comfort women's grandmothers lived in a community, and the Human Rights Museum with the theme of comfort women also opened. Just looking at the pictures and statues of the grandmothers who filled the walls, it makes me heartbroken. Every spring, a memorial service is held at the History Museum.
   <br/>
   Filling the quiet Gyeongancheon and Bunwon-ri with a solid sense of fullness is the local specialty of steamed carp. Downstream of Gyeongancheon has been famous for true fish. There are over 20 restaurants specializing in steamed carp in Bunwon-ri, and some restaurants boast a tradition of over 20 years. Fishing for crucian carp was banned to protect water resources, but the legend of crucian simmered with various secrets such as rugs continues to this day.
