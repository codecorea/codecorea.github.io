    Is it attracted to analog sensibility in the cutting edge era? You can read an e-book with a smartphone, tablet PC, or dedicated terminal, but it cannot replace the warm feeling of a paper book. Reading a book is more than just reading text, it is an act of combining various elements into one, such as feeling the texture of a paper, turning a bookcase, measuring the thickness of a book, and smelling paper. Turning off your smartphone for a while and opening a book is sometimes a pleasant break. It is in the same context that the two new libraries are welcome.

   The Naver Library is located in the Naver office located in Jeongja-dong, Seongnam-si. Right after entering the front door is the library. On the left is a book cafe where you can read various magazines in a more comfortable atmosphere. Libraries are only accessible with ID cards, and food is not allowed. Instead, anyone can go in and out of the book cafe, and enjoy a relaxing reading with fragrant coffee.

   It is interesting that Naver, the leader of Internet companies leading the era of digitalization and knowledge, has established a library for paper books. It is said that the entire lobby of the office building was made into a library, considering that 'Naver', an online space where people share knowledge, information, know-how or pleasure, and 'books' with various stories and experiences resemble each other.

   The first floor of the library consisted of information desk, locker, new book, design, architecture / interior, and small / independent publishing corner. The design section that occupies the largest area is divided into art, illustration, graphic, and industrial design / UX. The bookshelf is arranged in U, K, K, and so on, making it feel as if you have entered a forest of books. The road that breaks between the bookshelves is winding like a trail. A green plant growing on a bookshelf puts a pot on it, and it actually smells fresh.
