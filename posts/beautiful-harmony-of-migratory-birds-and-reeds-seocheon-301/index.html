   The reed forest in Seocheon is called the 4th reed forest nationwide along with the reed forest in Suncheon Bay, Jeollanam-do. It is also considered as the 'Korean Reed 7' by the Korea Tourism Organization. The size of the reed field, as well as the sight of the reed swaying in the wind, is truly spectacular. The landscape of the reed field was so difficult that it was the background of the movie JSA. The scene of Lee Byung-hun's first encounter with North Korean soldier Song Kang-ho takes place in this reed field. It is also the location of the TV drama Chuno, Sorry. The reed field is harmonious with the Geumgang water and the sunlight. It is also famous for its migratory colony. During the winter, Goni and Mallards swarm in reed forests.

   Seocheon is home to many wetlands and reed forests. In addition to the reed forests in Sinseong-ri, you can easily find the flowers blooming in colonies of fishing villages and gaet villages along the Seocheon coast. Seocheon has a different appearance in each season. In spring, the sound of life tumbling in the forest of reeds. In summer, the cool river breeze that has passed through the lush leaves cools the heat, and in the fall, the reed, with its head bowed at the end of the wind, feels the weight. In winter, it is sad and sad.

   The Hansan Mosikan also has a special feeling. Seocheon is a place where ramie was developed from the past. Hansan ramie is a high-grade sashimi produced in the area of Hansan-myeon, Seocheon-gun, Chungcheongnam-do. It is the fusion of the wisdom of our nation that can overcome the heat with a cool linen of red and red ginseng on a summer day. Seosan's Hansan Ramie is one of the major essences of our national culture, which is important enough to be registered as a National Intangible Cultural Heritage No. 14 and listed as a UNESCO human intangible cultural heritage (28 November 2011).

   The tangled narrative of Hansan Moshi dates back to the Three Kingdoms period. An old man climbed a medicinal herb to Mt. Geonji and found ramie grass. It started to cultivate ramie, and in the Joseon Dynasty, it was designated as a tribute to souvenirs from the Hansan area. If you make a loom on the loom, it looks like ramie will come out, but in fact, ramie is a fabric that requires a great deal of labor. Peel the skin from the stem of the linen, pick out only the soft flesh, dry it in the sun, and soak it in water for 1 to 2 hours to make a very soft tamoshi. Tamoshi is placed between the teeth, scraped into small pieces, and then placed on the mold with linen fibers and then glued together using the saliva of each lip to make soshigut.

   It doesn't end there. Loosen the ramie good, wind the thread enough to squeeze the ramie, put the ramie thread and feed the soybean grass to make the ramie smooth. It is only necessary to put this on a loom to complete Hanpil's ramie. It is very painful to squeeze the arm, and the tooth hurts to tear off the mossy. The process of making Taemoshi, putting it in a loom, and weaving it was a process of labor, so it was said that 'a dead tree is a man'. So tradition was born and passed on.
