   The short cut from Jongno to Insadong is fair to Gilchi. You can walk along someone's footsteps or walk around alone. It is a good place to have memories of an empty alley without a purpose.

There was a long and old alley in the middle of a complex and insane bell. As you walk along the tabac, the alley is narrow enough to bump into your shoulders.

You can see the way down to Insadong from the alley that continues as gracefully as the years passed by the faded red brick wall. In the secluded alley, Tteokbokki, rice, draft beer, cafe and tavern are gathered together. This is a restaurant alley in Insadong 3-gil, where only people you know come.

   Walnut pie meets drip coffee, Walnut tree cafe

   From the end of the alley leading to Insadong, you can see the Hanok Gate, which is arranged to the right. It is a door to walnut tree cafe. Although it was neatly remodeled, the walnut cafe was named after making an old table made of 300 year old walnut trees in the courtyard and the interior of Hanok.

   The hand drip coffee, which roasts beans from day to day to enhance the aroma and taste, is a rich body. The strong coffee aroma and the dense sense of exquisiteness make the coffee shop famous. Above all, the harmony of sweet and savory walnut pie in a cup of hot coffee is impressive. Based on six years of know-how accumulated at the Hanam store, it has been a year since it was located in the Insa-dong alley. Due to the nature of the alley, it still feels like a well-groomed but well suited to the calm atmosphere of the hanok. You can enjoy the rustic atmosphere while looking at the sky of the city from the terrace which has been transformed into an atmosphere by placing tables and chairs in the hanok yard. The summer night terrace is also a good place to drink cold beer, which has been on sale since July.

   Tteokbokki made with broth cooked for more than 4 hours with anchovies, kelp, defolie, emperor, onion, radish, garlic, and green onions in a cauldron is cool and crispy. The homemade tempura that comes with the set menu is fried and plain without any additives other than pure fried flour. Deep-fried foods such as laver, squid, red pepper, sweet potato, sesame leaf and shrimp are evenly crispy. Soup Tteokbokki is not spicy and not overly sweet, so it can be boring to anyone who wants a stimulating taste. So you have to eat it with broth. After eating Tteokbokki, the remaining soup turns delicious. The bibimbap in the set menu neatly removes the remaining broth. If you pour a ladle and rub it, the tuna, salted pickles, and laver powder go together exquisitely. Most of all, the bowls are empty, so it's a pleasant meal.
