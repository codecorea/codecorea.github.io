Without a sign, I wanted to bring people together with taste, affection, and atmosphere just like a small restaurant in the country that people always look for. Friends from high school have opened a shop without a signboard in July 2017, based on what they learned in their fields of operation, planning, marketing, and cooking. Since then, there is no signboard, so many people are coming.

   Ikseon-dong Hanok Alley was a perfect place for them to pursue a cozy restaurant like home. I thought it would be good to add restrained sophistication, leaving the old look of the space. Even the people doing the interior work advised that signs should be attached. I've never thought it was fashionable, but the three representatives are realizing the trend without signboards so that inquiries from the media such as magazines come in.

   Ikseon-dong Hanok Street, where there are no signs, is located in the center of downtown Seoul. It is a so-called urban-style Hanok, and Hanok Village was established by urban planning in the 1970s. In this place where meat shops, collections and noodles were used to fill the common people's stomachs, shops armed with stylish interiors are attracting many people of all ages. Waiting is the default for shops without signs. If you want to enjoy the atmosphere and taste of this house, the first thing you should do is write down your weighting notes. There are so many things to see and enjoy right in front of you, next to the alleys, so boredom is not allowed.
