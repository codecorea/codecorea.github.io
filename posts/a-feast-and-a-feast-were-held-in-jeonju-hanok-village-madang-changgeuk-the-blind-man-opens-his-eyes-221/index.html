    In the fairy tales, Kongzi hung a wide field, did a lot of laundry, and poured water on the poison that fell under. A feast of hearty food and delightful dance brings the heart of a young bean sprout to the heart of an old red bean rat mother. At a time when it is difficult to see the proper feast, there is a feast in Jeonju Hanok Village that will delight both men and women.

   Madang Changgeuk + Feast food + Traditional culture experience, 'Ilseok Samjo'
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    If you go to Jeonju Hanok Village, there are many cafes and restaurants that have been converted from hanok, museums and experience halls using hanok, and guest houses using hanok. There are many things to see and enjoy. However, there have been many stories that there is something lacking to properly experience traditional culture and art. In order to soothe such regrets, the Madang Changgeuk &lt;The Blind Man Awakens&gt; began with the name "Permanent Night Performance Using Hanok Resources." This is the second work of the Hanok Village Feast series following the Madang Changgeuk &lt;Looking at the Same Maple as the Moon&gt; which was introduced last year. If last year's performance was centered on the ‘Byeonsato Birthday Feast’ part of &lt;Chunhyangga&gt;, this year's ‘Hwangseong Blind Feast’ part of Pansori ‘Shim Cheongga’, ‘The Blind Man ’s Eyes Open’, was reconstructed as a 70-minute Madang Changgeuk. Best Singer Ahn Suk-seon, Jeonju University Practice Play National Contest Pansori Myeongchangbu Wang Ki-suk from the manor, Myeongchang Kim Sung-ye starring in MBC Madangnori, Jeollabuk-do Intangible Cultural Properties Artist Lee Soon-dan, and recently her husband, Dancer Poppin Hyunjun, KBS &lt; Stars of the Pansori world, such as Park A-ri, a famous singer who appeared in Immortal Song&gt; and showed emotion with &lt;Arirang&gt;, are attracting attention.
   </p>

  <div class="txt_p">
   The story of &lt;The Blind Man Awakens&gt;, which began its first performance on May 18, has already been sold out by word of mouth. In addition to the charm of ensuring that the quality of the performances is due to the appearance of many famous singers, it is new that the performances are performed on the Hanok stage in the outdoor amusement yard of the Jeonju-ri Cultural Center rather than the stuffy indoor space. Unlike classical performances that require quiet breathtaking, you can enjoy the spirit of Park Jang-Sae and ‘Eul-Soo-Goo, Good!’ Unlike Western classical music that sits down and appreciates, it is important that Korean traditional music breathes together. When these characteristics meet a special space called Hanok Madang, the taste is restored.

However, for safety reasons, except for moving the seat in the middle. ” Before the performance starts, the guide prepares to enjoy the performance in a relaxed manner.

   Enter the hanok from 1 hour before the performance and enjoy a rich feast. From this point on, my mind was already very comfortable. Jeonju's mothers dressed in hanbok come out and serve a lot of rice cakes, sprinkle, meat, fruits, and rice wine. After the hot sunshine has passed, the heart is disarmed after eating the feast food in the hanok courtyard.

   When the shoulders are fluttering because of the excitement, the performance begins with the appearance of the exciting pungmul plaque. Demonstrating the advantages of Madang Changgeuk, the performance is not limited to the stage, but goes between the pavilion on the back of the auditorium or between the auditoriums. There are also many children who come with mom and dad at the venue. If it is 70 minutes long, the children will not get bored for a long time. This is also because he develops the story quickly through intermediate and intermediate animations and shadow effects. Instead of the standardized screen, it is more interesting because it is unfolded in the background of the main hall of Hanok made of Korean paper. Pansori, which has a high level of masterpieces, impresses you, and a thick talk makes you laugh.

   In the classic &lt;Shimcheongjeon&gt;, the role of the mother-in-law, Deok-deok, stands out. He throws chupa all over the place, and even hits Hwang Bong-sa and creates an “Alna-kari-nak” scene. Especially, in the scene where Deok-deok and Hwang Bong-sa dance Psy's &lt;Gangnam Style&gt;, everyone is excited. Hwang Bong-sa's natural virtuosity and smoky smoke give it a rich taste. After the performance was over, I didn't notice the fact that Hwang Bong-sa was a male woman until I checked and checked the brochure. As such, the performance of Hwangbongsa in Myeongchang Lee's myeongchang was perfect. The role of Simbongsa, Simcheong, Hwangbongsa, and Deokdeokmi is played by 3 or 4 people, and I wonder how they will digest each masterpiece.

    There is another reason why children and adults are happy. Because the experience distance was added immediately. Seven traditional cultural experiences are held at representative museums and cultural centers of Hanok Village. Making a Korean paper notebook at Samdoheon where you can experience various traditional cultures such as hanok experience, making your own fan at the fan culture museum showing all of Jeonju fan, complete version (referring to the old book and its version published in Jeonju) and the importance of documentary culture Ali at the Wanpanbon Cultural Center experiences woodcuts, creates a fan 'Songlimseon' with Banghwasun's chief, and takes a rice wine at the Traditional Wine Museum. The tea ceremony experience progresses. Of these, three or four experiences are held every week, so you can select one and use it fully. It's a pretty good configuration, as you can enjoy a fun traditional culture experience, hearty feast food, and even a high-quality yard changgeuk when you break a ticket.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The &lt;The Blind Man Awakens&gt; performance will be held every Saturday at 8 pm until October 5th. The ticket price for watching performances, experiencing traditional culture, and feasting is 25,000 won. 30-50% discount depending on various conditions. Even the receipts used at Hanok Village are discounted by 30%, so most do not pay the price. Advance reservations are essential as word of mouth is gaining popularity. All you need to do is collect your performance tickets and experience coupons between 2pm and 4:30 pm on the day of the performance. Popular experiences may close first, so it's a good idea to go early and get an experience coupon. Go to the selected experience place at 5 pm, enjoy the traditional culture experience, and then go to Jeonju-ri Cultural Center before 7 pm and line up. It is not a designated seat system, so if you go a little bit, you can take a good seat.

Instead of the main character-oriented ending that only opens the eyes of Sim Bong-sa, all the blind people from all over the world open their eyes to the heart of the true happy ending.
