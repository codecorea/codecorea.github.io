   There are many fun museums in winter even on Jeju Island. Among them, the museum introduces an experience museum that can be used to educate children and also be enjoyed by adults.

   Chocolate Museum
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The Chocolate Museum is amazing from the outside. Once the facade of the museum looks like the architecture of the South American Inca civilization, the birthplace of cacao. Also, as soon as you enter, you are welcomed by the coffee and it is more fun. The Chocolate Museum is a fun place to look at all the chocolates in each region, including the history of chocolate. The museum features chocolate statues and famous cultural works. Is it because it melts because many people touch it with their hands? Of course you should look only with your eyes.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The pavilion starts with a poster for the chocolate factory of the movie Charlie, which will be interesting to children. Also explain how to make chocolate from cacao. There is also a space that reproduces the chocolate of the ancient Aztec civilization, which is intrigued by the model train coming and going around. One side of the museum explains the types and benefits of cacao. I only know that chocolate can help me regenerate, but I first learned that there are so many different types of cacao.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    In the museum, there is a quiz game to convey knowledge of various chocolate cacao through not only exhibitions but also quizzes.
    <br/>
    It is not just an enumeration, but an exhibition that induces the interest and participation of visitors through various attempts such as chocolate quiz, chocolate misunderstanding and truth.
   </p>
   <p>
    The second floor displays chocolates and tea cups, mostly from medieval Europe. Chocolate is now popular, but in the past it was only used by the upper classes in Europe as a premium drink. The spaces that explain the colorful and diverse look-and-feel exhibitions and related stories also attracted many people.

   Teddy Bear Museum
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Now let's go to the Teddy Bear Museum located in Jungmun, Jeju Island. Teddy Bear is a teddy bear that everyone knows. I've made and constructed a museum and I'm curious how to decorate it. First of all, it seems to be popular with children in terms of the theme of teddy bears.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Once inside the museum, it consists of various structures, such as a history hall decorated with teddy bear dolls, important events of modern history of humanity, and an art museum decorated with works of art in teddy bears, and exhibitions. Starting with the birth of the car, various events such as the moon landing of mankind and the return of Hong Kong to China are centered on teddy bear dolls. It is an educational museum for children and a cute and cute museum for adults.
   </p>
   <p>
    The museum's interior art gallery draws Van Gogh's paintings as teddy bears and draws visitors with a variety of themes such as Teddy Bears decorated with Louis Vuitton. There is also a teddy bear souvenir shop in the basement. Parents who have been holding their children's hands can get out of here by buying teddy bear dolls.

    Lastly, there is a hidden teddy bear performance, Elvis Presley. The show is not long, but Elvis Presley dances and music in Teddy Bear and is worth seeing. The venue is located a little far from the main exhibition hall, but don't forget to stop by.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Teddy Bear Museum has outdoor gardens and outdoor stages as well. These days it's midwinter, so I couldn't go outdoors, but if it's a nice day in summer, the outdoor garden with grass plaza and walking trails will be a good gift for nature with cool sea breeze.

   Haenyeo Museum
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Now move to the Haenyeo Museum near Seongsanpo. Isn't it a haenyeo that can not be missed in Jeju Island? Haenyeo Museum is operated by Jeju Island and consists of three exhibition rooms with the theme of Jeju Island Haenyeo.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The dormitory of Haenyeo, the first exhibition room, shows the life of haenyeo in Jeju Island. A traditional house was recreated and the village of Jeju Island was modeled next to it. In addition, there are various exhibitions such as living utensils, food culture and customs.

    The second exhibition room, Haenyeo's Workplace, is a showroom that maximizes the visual effect by decorating the dolls and showing them as images. You can also find out about the hierarchies of haenyeo and the daily life of haenyeo. There are also spaces that show the achievements of devoted women who have dedicated themselves to the nation, such as the Haenyeo Anti-Japanese Movement.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the third exhibition room, Haenyeo's life, she can become the first woman in her life and see her various hierarchies. There are also interesting exhibits, such as a video where you can listen to live experiences of divers.

    Lastly, there is the Children's Haenyeok, an experience hall for children. This is a place where only children and guardians can enter. Children can become more familiar with Haenyeo by playing with Jeju Haenyeo related rides.
   </p>
   <p>
    Haenyeo Museum is proud of its outdoor park. The open-air large park is called Haenyeom Square, which also houses the Jeju Haenyeo Anti-Japanese Movement Memorial Monument.
