    It is an ambassador of tvN &lt;Solo Drinking Man and Woman&gt; which recently ended. In a busy and fast competitive era, what we need is perhaps a one-time break and comfort. Here's a `` Sleep To Drink '' trip to a modern day.
   </p>

  <div class="txt_p">
   Beyond honbab, it is the age of honsul According to the 2015 National Statistical Office data, the proportion of single households in Korea's total population is 27.1%. Three out of ten households are single households. This is an increase of about 7% compared to 2000, when 20% of the population was a single household. It's hard to get a good job because of employment shortages, job insecurity, and marriage and childbirth. This is why voluntary, selective non-marriage is bound to increase. With the increase in the number of single-person households, the era of playing alone and eating began in earnest.

  <strong class="ar_title">
   Why did we drink alone?
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Nevertheless, drinking alcohol alone requires considerable courage. When I open the door and enter the shop, the eyes of those who sit together and lean over the glass seem to be on me. A loud employee's "Are you alone?" If you add a kill, most of the K.O. Most eager drinks are given up at this moment.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Of course, if you have a thick face specially processed so that samgyeopsal or giblets go alone. You can go anywhere to eat and drink WINNER. But for the most part it is difficult. Wouldn't it be better if we could enter alone and have a drink alone? At least 'three or more politely refused' if the shop will be able to visit more and more souls.

   I looked for places where I could have a light drink on my way home from work. Already added the hangout of famous places and lovers among the Honsul. Eating and drinking alone is cooler than you think. You don't even have to keep time with someone, so you don't have to keep talking. I only drink and time together. Sit in the bar and share the worries of life with the jokes and jokes of people who live in uninhabited land. We who are free because we are free but lonely are comforted by such perfect others.

   First, let's go to the liquor restaurant that means `` you drink a glass of alcohol alone ''. This German house is located in an alley deep inside the university. At first glance, the idea is whether it is a German house or a German house.

  <div class="txt_p">
   If you come out of Hyehwa Station Exit 3 or 4, enter Café Bene Alley and enter the alley of Apgujeong Beer. The quiet Hanok building welcomes you with its strong coffee flavor. Opened the menu while enjoying the relaxed atmosphere of the shop. A variety of alcoholic drinks await you as a shop that recommends a drink alone. You can choose from dark draft beer such as `` Heretic Evil Twin Red Ale '', `` Old Rasputin '', `` Schneider Mine Hovenweise Tap '' and `` Sculppin IPA '' to cocktails using gin and tonic.
