   If you are a fan of war movies or dramas, there is a place that will open your eyes and interest you.

   The familiar Urk base, which occupies most of the 'sun descendants' background, is one of the oldest US military bases where the 2nd Division 506th Infantry Battalion, which remained after the Korean War Armistice Agreement, returned to it in August 2007.

   Camp Greaves is just 2 km from the southern limit of the demilitarized zone (DMZ), a demilitarized zone designed to prevent clashes between the two Koreas. The military withdrew in 2004, but the trace remains intact and tells the story. On the land of more than 200,000 square meters, various facilities such as the repair shop where Song Joong-gi performed great action through the fighting scene with the US military in the `` Descendants of the Sun '', officers' accommodations, dormitories and gymnasiums are preserved as they are. It is worth it.
