    Ansan Multicultural Village Special Zone is connected to Ansan Station on Subway Line 4. After exiting Exit 1 and passing Jungang-daero, you can see a multicultural food street. Even if it is not a signboard on the road, you can see that it is a special district in Ansan Multicultural Village. This is because restaurants, shops, and other amenities such as banks mostly use foreign language signs. The expression is written in large local languages and small in English and Korean. The design and color are reflected in the characteristics of each country, so it is confusing whether it is Korea, Vietnam, or Russia. Oga also contributes to the unusual scenery of foreign languages mixed with their conversation.

    First, let's go to the Ansan City World Culture Experience Center. Opened as a multicultural public relations learning center in 2012 to show the power of diversity, it exhibits more than 1,400 pieces of musical instruments, dolls, masks, and rides collected from over 50 countries, and uses these exhibits to experience the traditional culture of each country. Decorated with a space to do. If the singing ball that rubs the rim of a kalimba called a brass piano and a brass-like body is a musical instrument for all adult children, among 130 dolls, the Ghanaian traditional doll aqua bar known as the model of the movie `` ET '' and `` Russian Dooly Cheburashka, which leads to 'is popular. Japanese traditional rides such as Hanetsuki and Kendama are also interesting. Kendama plays by vertically moving a ball suspended in a row into the groove under the handle. Hanetsuki, who exchanges feathered balls with a wooden racket, is a play that girls enjoyed wearing kimonos during the New Year's Day.

    It is regrettable to skip the food while talking about the special district of Ansan Multicultural Village. It is a neighborhood where people of various nationalities gather, so the food is rich. With a focus on multicultural food streets, there are 184 restaurants serving different countries, including China, Indonesia, Nepal, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Russia and Uzbekistan. Among them, 62 establishments employ local professional chefs according to the “Local Chef Recommendation System” of the Ansan Foreign Residents Support Headquarters. The advantage is that you can taste local food without going far by plane. The same rice noodles have different tastes from Thai and Vietnamese restaurants, and lamb skewers from Chinese and Uzbek restaurants are completely different.

    The interior is also different for each country, so depending on which restaurant you go to, you can eat in a completely different atmosphere. Most of the restaurant employees are foreigners, so it's a bit difficult to communicate, but it's interesting because I feel like I've been abroad. Of course, there are no problems with ordering or making calculations. In the multicultural food street, there are as many easy-to-eat Jujeon Buri as the restaurant menu. An adult biceps (yotiao), a Chinese hotteok, and a meat bread (samsa) that is essential at the Russian table that Chinese people enjoy as a substitute for breakfast, fits well in our mouths. I am curious about the taste of duck eggs marinated in salt for more than 20 days and the loach fried whole brown.

    Silkworm Island is a landmark of Ansan tourism. It connects to the land through a road that opens twice a day at low tide. When you climb the lighthouse observatory on the silkworm island, Jebudo Island and the West Sea can be seen at a glance. From Tando Port to Nue Island Lighthouse Observatory, it takes about 1km one way, and it takes about 20 minutes to walk slowly. When going to Silkworm Island, be sure to check the tide. Ansan Fishing Village Folk Museum is located in front of Tando Port. Daebu Island is a space that introduces the lives of various islands and island villages in tidal flats.
