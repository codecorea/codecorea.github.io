    The season of red bean shaved ice has come. You can taste it all the time only at home, but no matter what anyone says, it's summer. From franchise bread shops to coffee shops, everyone is showing a variety of shaved ice. Let's follow along with a piece of red bean ice water. “Bingsu, red bean shavings! The song comes out.

    Here is one person who wishes that one day, “Self-bean shaved ice house”, which you can make and eat as much as you like, comes out. How nice would it be if a person who tasted as much as possible by eating a lot of chocolate syrup and condensed milk on a softly ground ice like snowflake and topped with glutinous rice cake and jelly? Furthermore, how exciting would it be if there was something grim like the “Hot Summer Bingsu Festival” that would blow away the heat?

    I confess in advance. Reporters are not gourmets. My mouth was sweet from birth. Thanks to you, eat deliciously. People who know ask 'no place' instead of 'delicious place'. Dare to claim though. ‘Taste’ is not the only area of taste. This is because our brain stores all things together with food, such as the memories of the person sitting on the bed and the mind of the owner who prepared the bed.

   It is the same reason that many restaurants may be a space that is not hungry again for someone. On the contrary, a house that everyone says is not good can be a place for someone to remember forever. Among the five senses, the “taste” that can be experienced only by chewing actively contains both the air and touch of the day. Choosing a main menu and then finding homes that are famous for their food can be pointless. Still, people want. Restaurants that specialize in cold noodles, bulgogi, and noodles. It is in the same context that Seoul's red bean ice water map was drawn.

    At this point, you may start your tour of Seoul Red Bean Bingsu. Attaching a long family before the full-scale red bean shaving tour means that you understand that even if the red bean shaving collection that you consider the best is missing. We looked for a variety of red bean (ice water) specialty shops that make red beans to go up to shaved ice directly from shaved ice of old memories. I haven't left out the red bean shavings that are the most 'hot' these days. Now, I think the red bean bingsu's red bean is famous, but no matter what anyone says, the beginning and end of the red bean bingsu is 'red bean'. The process of turning red beans into red beans requires more balls than you think. In a house where you can taste red bean porridge and red bean shaved ice, you often make red beans yourself. 'Adzuki bean' is the main character. Wouldn't it be worthwhile to believe in the red bean soup collection where you can taste red bean porridge together? On a map, I collected red bean shavings that are delicious in Seoul. How to feel the taste with your mouth, not the letters. Why don't you take a map on a summer day and go on a tour of red bean ice water?

    When you talk about red bean shaved ice, you can't miss &lt;Miltop&gt; Bingsu It is famous for the aid of milk ice water. The 5th floor of Apgujeong Branch of Hyundai Department Store welcomes people with its main store. Milk Bingsu is literally bingsu that has frozen milk finely grinded like a snowflake. It is softer because it is milk ice. Here, a moderately boiled red bean goes up. You may think it's similar to the red bean iced water you've eaten, but once you put it in your mouth, you can say 'it's delicious'. There are cooks who boil only red beans, so there are many regulars thanks to maintaining a steady taste. Red beans can be refilled, so if you like them, you can enjoy them. In addition to the main store, you can enjoy it at Hyundai Department Store, such as Sinchon, Mokdong, and Ilsan. It is not large. Milk iced water for 7,000 won per person.

    Perhaps strawberry shaved ice and waffles were introduced first. It is located at the beginning of Sookdae. I followed the high school senior who was located near the triangle, and I can't forget the taste of the strawberry shaved ice. The course is to eat pure noodles with tofu in &lt;Kachine&gt; and to go with strawberry shaved ice and waffles in &lt;Waffle House&gt;. On the finely ground ice, a slightly frozen strawberry is placed on top of it and vanilla soft ice cream is added. After removing the ice cream, the taste of strawberry shaved ice! It is perfect for female students. (After meal) One serving of strawberry ice water is enough for two. Strawberry shaved ice from 5,000 won per serving and 2000 won from waffles.

    Thanks to the location near Sinchon Train Station, the price is low, as many students come to visit. Instead, the line is long even on rainy weekdays. Finely ground ice and red bean sediment are served separately. It is easy to understand if you think of it as the liver of the red bean ice water system. You can mix it according to your taste or eat it separately. The soft milk ice's natural taste and the red beans, which are chewy, are still delicious.

    The name “Dong Bingo”, which means ice storage in the Joseon Dynasty, is interesting. It's a name that gets cooler just by listening, but it basically requires strong patience to taste Bingsu. You can taste red bean shaved ice and red bean porridge all year round. The most popular shaved ice menu is basic red bean ice and royal milk tea. Condensed milk and milk are hidden under the finely ground ice, so mix well to taste. Although it looks like nothing else, red beans and fine ice, faithful to the basics, keep your mouth cool and tidy. Red bean shaved ice 6500 won, Royal milk tea shaved ice 7000 won.
