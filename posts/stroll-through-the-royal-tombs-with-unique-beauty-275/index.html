   Anyone who has seen photographer Byung-Woo Bae's pine forest in Queen Seondeok wants to go there. There are many royal tombs where the kings of Silla are asleep. And there is a pine tree on the royal tomb. The path leading to the royal tomb along the pine forest is the first beautiful scenery that impresses before the history of Silla and the achievements of the king.

   Among the royal tombs of Gyeongju where pine forests are beautiful, Queen Seondeok and Samneung are indispensable, but pine forests in Jeonggang and Heunggang are also beautiful. Kings of Heongang and King Jeonggang are kings of the period of the end of the Unified Silla period, when the country was inclined. Jeongneung Royal Tombs and Heunggang Royal Tombs are not only close to the Tongiljeon, which is located on the eastern side of Namsan in Gyeongju, but also have two royal tombs side by side.

   King Heongang is the son of King Gyeongmun, who is known for his “King's ears are donkey ears.” It is also interesting that since King Heongang, King Jeonggang, King Jinseong, and King Hyogong are all the sons and daughters of King Gyeongmun. At least until the Hwanggang Dynasty, I can feel Silla's national cloud that flourished after the unification of the Three Kingdoms. One day King Heongang climbed down on the top of the moon with his servants and looked down at the crowded private house. King Heongang asked the civilian public. “I heard that people say that they are roofing with tile, not straw, and charcoal, not wood. Is that true?” In response to this, there is an article in the book "The Three Kingdoms History" in which the civilians of the city replied that they were. When King Heongang climbed in 11 years of reign, King Jeonggang was crowned. King Jeonggang is the younger brother of King Heongang. King Jeonggang passed away after he passed the throne to his younger sister, Queen Jinseong, within a year of reign without any time to continue the reign of King Heongang.

   The royal tombs of Heunggang and the royal tombs of Jeonggang are not large, but simple and modest, such as the tombs of Daereungwon, Labor, and Noseo-dong. The royal tomb of Heongang was built in four steps, returning to the grave to prevent the soil from flowing down as a circular soil. The royal tomb of Jeonggang also looks similar, but is said to be a special case among the royal tombs of Silla. It is recommended to visit Heongang Royal Tombs and Jeonggang Royal Tombs to Namsan at around 3 ~ 4 pm when the sun is overlooked. This is because the last sunlight of the day spreads over the pine forest and is spectacular. Heunggang Royal Mausoleum is designated as Historic Site No. 187, while Jeonggang Royal Mausoleum is designated as Historic Site No. 186.

   In the meantime, you can meet the most certain and most beautiful royal tomb, which is Seongdeok Royal Tombs. King Seongdeok is the first person to meet at the National Gyeongju Museum, the so-called 'Emileson'. King Gyeongdeok made this bell in honor of his father King Seongdeok's merit. King Seongdeok succeeded King Munmu and King Shinmun, who are the main characters of the Three Kingdoms Unification, and became king after the King of Enzymes. After the reunification of the Three Kingdoms, he was the king who led the heyday of Silla, with a reign of 36 years.

   The Royal Tomb of Seongdeok is a royal tomb that remains almost completely in shape as a royal tomb of the Unified Silla period. In order to protect a large tomb that is 46m in diameter, a wide stone about 90cm high was put on it and a cover stone was placed on it. In addition, a triangular stone was supported outside the tomb to prevent the wide stone from falling.

    If you follow the National Highway No. 7 from Seongdeok Royal Tombs and head toward Gyeongju City, you will meet Sinmun Royal Tombs, Sacheon Wangsaji, and Queen Seondeok. After passing the Gyeongju Neungjitop and descending along Soro, the farm road in Bomundeul-eul continues. There is a tomb to the left of the field head, the tomb of Queen Jinpyeong, Queen of Queen Seondeok. Could there have been more dynamic times in the history of Silla than the times of King Jinheung and King Jinpyeong? As it appeared in the drama &lt;Queen Seondeok&gt;, Queen Seondeok succeeded King Jinpyeong, Queen Seongdeok who was known for Gyeongguk, Sadada and Munno, well-known as galleries, and Muyeolwang and Kim Yusin, the leading roles of the Three Kingdoms Unification. It was.

   The royal tomb of Jinpyeong remains large and large. The dignity of the Silla royal family cannot be found, but it feels simple and elegant. A small pine tree bows its head toward the Royal Mausoleum like a municipal bell, and it seems to be shooting Hwaryong Peak in the landscape. The royal tomb of Jinpyeong overlooks Mt. It's as if you're looking at Queen Seondeok, a daughter sleeping in Nansan. The royal tomb of Jinpyeong is designated as the historic site No. 180.
