    Sea fish called Gomchi in the East Sea, water catfish in the South Sea, and water fish in the West! The season of Gomchi caught across the coast of the Korean Peninsula has arrived. Another reason why lovers and gourmets from all over the country are waiting for the winter, heading to Samcheok, his hometown, to taste Gomchi soup, a taste of winter season.

    The winter east coast is rich. This is thanks to a variety of foods that will satisfy our taste, unlike the look that looks lonely. For the same reason, gourmets and lovers from all over the country run to the east coast in winter. Start with Yangmi-ri and Guamegi in the northern part of Gangwon, and head down the east coast. Samcheok's gomchi soup with a sweet drink, gourmets' taste, and the long legs snow crab of Uljin and Yeongdeok, and Gwamegi of Pohang, are all lined up with ‘delicious things’.
   </p>
   <p>
    Among them, if Yangmi-ri and Guamegi, and snow crab and Guamegi are 'Anju Yong', 'Gomchiguk' is 'Haejangyong' to solve all of them in one shot. Of course, it's a great 'flavor' for a single meal without dividing it into anjuyong and haejangyong, but if you visit the scene to taste them, so if you come across the winter sea breeze and face these foods, the idea of 'hanzan' You will hear by itself. Why the winter sea is so bright (remembering alcohol)!

    I want to go to taste all the food on the east coast because I feel like it. If you have a drink in Yangmi-ri and snow crab and dissolve with Gomchi-guk, then go to Pohang and finish with Gwamegi and Water, what's the better winter coastal taste of East Coast? However, the main character of this tour is Gomchiguk, which is relatively less known than other winter coastal delicacies.

    Gomchi soup, as its name suggests, is a fish called Gomchi. The name of this guy caught across the coast of Korea is slightly different from coast to coast. It is called Gomchi or Water Bear in the East Sea, Water Mage or Water Catfish in the South Sea, and Jambang or Water Tumbang in the West Sea. It can be interpreted that it is as common and popular that the word for the same fish varies from coast to coast. The most familiar name for us right now is water catfish and water squirrel, among which ‘water squirrel’ is the name that fishermen who caught gomchi threw ‘tumbles’ back into the water after seeing the appearance. The appearance of Gomchi, which can never be observed, can be seen in his nickname.

    However, in the Encyclopedia of Fish in the Joseon Dynasty &lt;Jangsaebo&gt;, Jeong Yak-jeon wrote Gomchi and said, "The taste is mild and good for the sake bottle." It wasn't that the name of Multumbung was a joke from the bosses who caricatured his ugly appearance. Or maybe it was a trick by lovers who noticed the true value of Gomchi. A name that was called ‘water bear’ or ‘gomchi’ because of its dark appearance is like a bear is also a good hint of his appearance. Some of the divers are bitter because of their ferocious nature, they are far from the appearance and personality that can be loved.

   Nevertheless, the only thing that Gomchi is loved is because of the 'flavor'. Unlike the outrageous personality and ugly appearance, the soft flesh that melts at the tip of the tongue and the cool soup taste! The lyrics to the song “I want to see once and see twice and keep looking” are transferred to “I want to eat once and eat twice and keep eating”.

   The texture of this fish coexists with soft flesh and slippery skin texture. The viscous part between the skin and the flesh may be unfamiliar to the newcomers, but if you are a lover, you will get used to it after you taste it twice. Those who like 'Agujjim (Aguijjim is the real name)' come up with a similar texture. At first, the slippery viscous part is awkward because it is “like a runny nose,” but sometimes they argue that they will eat each other. In the case of Samcheok Gomchi soup, which is boiled with old paper, it is easy to pass by mouth. Ah, there are differences in how to cook Gomchi soup and how it comes out.
