   Sejong (pseudonym) in his late 40s with the motto of "The journey continues until life is over." He set the summer vacation as Jeju Island. Jeju Island is not the first. Nevertheless, I chose Jeju Island without hesitation because of the expectation of a new trip. What caught Sejong's heart is the coastal round road called 'Jeju Fantastic Bike Path'.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The Jeju Fantastic Bike Path is a course that cycles around Jeju Island along a coastal road with little traffic. It was opened in November 2015. Sejong says the reason for choosing a bicycle tour.
   <br/>
   "In the light of my previous experience, I thought I could make the trip enjoyable. When I walked Jeju Olle, I saw a lot of young friends traveling on bicycles, so I also wanted to travel like this one day, and after the trip, I felt like it. "
   <br/>
   Even though he grew older and became a middle-aged body, his mind was always young, so Sejong decided to take a bicycle trip to Jeju Island.

   Sejong's challenge course is 21km from Yongduam Certification Center to Darak Shelter Certification Center. This is the first course of the Jeju Fantastic Bicycle Path. There is a reason for his choice. It would be nice to implement a grand plan called "Jongju" at once, but it is very unlikely. I know that like the mind, the body won't be able to keep up, so I know I have to try it many times. In that case, I decided that it would be better to try in order from the first course. He plans to turn Jeju Island counterclockwise along the coast. That way, you can run facing the sea.

   Sejong has two colleagues to accompany. Put your body on the bike. I never think it will be difficult. It seemed easier than walking. 'Olle also walked, it's about a bike', 'If anyone knows how to ride a bicycle, anyone can do it. I think it's never hard, 'and press the pedal vigorously. Sejong's advice was also comforting to the bloggers' advice that the Jeju Fantastic Bicycle Path was built on a gentle flatland, and that it was easy to find and can be challenged even for beginners.

   Even Hagwi-ri runs with care for safety, so it will be fun. Even if the sea is by the side, I cannot afford to enjoy it. When I'm annoyed, I find joy in Sejong. After crossing the Bongcheon 2nd Bridge in Hagwi 2-ri, I went to Aewol Coastal Road on the right, and the desired ride began. Few people pass by, and there are few vehicles. The road is also smooth. After walking for a while on Gamun-dong, the sea comes close to you. Only then can I park my bike for a while and enjoy the sea. The sky is blue, and the sea is infinitely clear and transparent. Sejong enjoys the scenery by saying, 'This is Jeju Island, I did a good job riding a bicycle.'

   However, there are many hills in the area between Gugeolli and Gonaeri, making it one of the most difficult courses on the Jeju Fantastic Bike. Sejong, who cannot tell the truth, is happy. I think that the road ahead will continue to be the same as now.

It's a good way to speed up as much as you like. Sejong does not speed up. I didn't want to miss the view of the sea by focusing on running.

   Trials have come to a well-run colleague. Uphill appeared. I slowly climb the road by applying strength to my legs. The problem is that the ascent is not one. After one is over, another appears. If you go over it, you can see the uphill again. Just looking at it causes dizziness and sighs.
   <br/>
   'What do we do. I wonder if I can go. ' just as expected. A bicycle running on the flat land meets uphill, and the speed slows down infinitely. It is natural that the speed decreases as the number of pedaling steps decreases. The jaw fills up. They start to lag behind the party. Shifting hunger whenever it's hard doesn't speed it up. It's hard.
   <br/>
   I throw a word if my colleague riding together was frustrated. "The key to shifting gears is maintaining speed. You need to shift in advance so that you can maintain speed even on hills."
   <br/>
   If you run at a speed of 15 km on the flat, it means to shift gears in advance so that you can maintain speed before climbing the hill. I understand the problem with my head, but I don't know when to shift gears. 'So when do you want to shift?'

When it is difficult, it is a pleasure to travel while walking for a while and relaxingly admiring the seascape over the coastal cliff.

   The party has long been out of sight. 'Where should I follow this loneliness and heaviness?' Thinking, dragging a bicycle and walking struggling. In the midst of this, the sparkling sea catches the eye in the summer. If you look at the fantastic sea light, the fascinating color of the sea will never be erased from your mind forever. I am reminded of the words of Plato, an ancient Greek philosopher, suddenly in an enchanting landscape.
   <br/>
   "All things are created by nature or human technology, the greatest and the most beautiful are created in nature, and the least and the most imperfect are made by human technology."

Although people have artificially articulated the beauty of nature, the light is so rich that it is not enough to cover the pure light emitted by nature. As time goes by, the nature that puts on the weight of the years and creates a more serious look. Mr. Sejong admires the greatness of nature and expresses gratitude. From year to year, it contains the sky and clouds, and mixes mountains, trees, and wind to flow as it is.

   Press the pedal carefully again. It runs slowly as if walking on a frozen river. Being alone is lonely, difficult, but the mind does not shake.

   Although it was a short, short-distance bike trip, the memories will always remain in your heart.
