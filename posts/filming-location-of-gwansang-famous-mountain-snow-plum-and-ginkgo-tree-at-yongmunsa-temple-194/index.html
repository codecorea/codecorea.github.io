    Seolmaejae is the filming location for the movie &lt;Kwannwan&gt;, the best topic in the second half of 2013. It was a time when the family of Naekyung (Song Kang-ho) lived comfortably.

   It is November. The wind is quite cold along the Namhan River. Everywhere is uneven. It is late autumn. It's perfect because the pickling is in harmony. In particular, Yangpyeong is more busy in autumn because it has many famous mountains. Yumyeongsan Mountain, Yongmunsan Mountain, and Jungmisan Mountain show off slightly different charms. Then there are different statues on the mountain. Pungsu geography is a contemplation of nature.

   Not long ago, the movie &lt;Contemplation&gt; became popular. It was the tenth in the Korean film industry, attracting 9 million audiences. The actors' strong acting also stood out, but the material of ornamental was also a significant influence on the box office. &lt;Contemplation&gt; is set in the background of the sedation. This was the case when the Sooyang Grand Army removed Kim Jong-seo, etc., and took Danjong's throne. At the center of its history, the ornamental contest follows Kim Nae-kyung's gaze.

   The first scene is the path that Gisaeng Yeon-hong (Hye-soo Kim) visits the inner diameter. The inner diameter lives like a Moorim coriander hiding in the middle of the night. There may be a factor called the family of a rebellious family, but I wonder if I already knew my contemplation and lived in hiding. Nevertheless, what about that talent? People come by hearing the word of mouth. Parasitic lotus is one of them. It is an intention to try to make a lot of money by using the talent of inner diameter. They find themselves disguised as merchants, but they cannot fool the current contemplative.

   The autumn scenery on the way to the house of Naekyung at first glance resembles the red lips of the red. It is the Seolmaejae Passage, which is the foot of the famous mountain. It is named after plum blossoms bloom even when it snows a lot. Since 1999, a private recreational forest has been in operation on the ridge. It is well known to camping enthusiasts with its log cabin and auto camping site. Within the recreational forest, there were Damo Forest and Soseono Forest. Drama &lt;Damo&gt; and &lt;Jumong&gt; were filmed here.

Fortunately, the cool landscape opens as soon as we make up for the regret. On the left side of the road, Yongmunsan and Baekwoonbong boast great pride. It is a mountain that can feel autumn. Below that is the Namhan River stem. As if taking a breath, stop walking and look at you for a long time.

If you take the Wangnam course, you can walk while enjoying the surrounding scenery. In particular, there was a tree in autumn with autumn leaves, and the sloping silver grass field and the surrounding mountains are impressive.

On one side, there is a small arch made of ocher like the trace. A silver grass rises along the ridge through the back door, and the autumn landscape spreads out through the front door. In the old days, it was used as a filming location for the drama &lt;The Garden of the Winds&gt;. This is where Kim Hong-do and Shin Yun-bok met. It has recently been used as a filming location for the drama &lt;Goddess of Fire&gt; after the movie &lt;Contemplation&gt;. Since modern civilization is not close, it is a good place to shoot historical dramas.

   If you miss the autumn leaves than silver grass, it is better to turn your foot toward Yongmun Mountain than famous one. It takes about 30 minutes by car from Seolmaejae to Yongmunsan (it's too much to use public transportation). If there is silver grass in Seolmaejae, Yongmunsan is the autumn leaves. The best among them is the 1,100-year-old ginkgo tree of Yongmunsa Temple. As I foretell the fact, when I get close to the tourist attractions of Yongmunsan, ginkgo trees are greeted. Some still have a blue color, but the golden yellow color marks the peak of autumn. The road leading up to the entrance to Yongmunsan Mountain is perfect for a drive course.

   Walk up 1km along the forest path to Yongmunsa Temple. As the valley opens, red maple leaves appear instead of ginkgo trees. Yongmunsa Temple was founded in 2 years (913) by King Silla of Silla. It has nothing to do with the Suyangdae army in &lt;Contemplation&gt;. At the age of thirty (1447), he was ordered by King Sejong and first visited Yongmunsa to build a preservation for his mother, Queen Soheon, Sim. When he was forty years old three years after he was crowned the throne, he visited Yongmunsa Temple once more to replace the temple. The stricken distress (1453) to end the discontinuation was an incident in the meantime. It is the ginkgo tree of Yongmunsa Temple that I watched all day after day. Under the shade, the last line of the inner diameter in &lt;Contemplation&gt; comes to mind.

   Yongmunsa Ginkgo tree is said to have been planted on the way to Mt. Its history also matches the inner diameter. It is said that the costume ambassador's staff sprouted and became a ginkgo tree, and there is a legend that he made a sound whenever there was a big problem in the country. It is said that the Japanese army set fire to Yongmunsa Temple during the Korean War against the American Army (1907), but did not burn only ginkgo trees. You can tell by facing the ginkgo tree. It is not a tree that will be shaken by some interference. The wind is also dignified to pass. It's worth it as the leader reaches 1,100 years. It is about 42m high and the circumference of the base is 15.2m. It is the oldest and largest ginkgo tree in Korea. Even if you climb the stairs and face the Daeungjeon Hall, you cannot reach the height of the tree. So, Yongmunsa Temple is about 1,100 years ago.

On the first weekend in November, the greenery was so dark that those who visited Yongmunsa temple devoured the regret. On the contrary, the autumn leaves of Yongmunsan will be more colorful. It culminated in late October through early November. If the normal person, Gaesupbong, is busy, a light hike from Yongmunsa Temple to Senate Temple is also not bad. If it's overwhelming, it's good to chew the words of Jinhyeong's son Jinhyung. He replied to the question of what was the most difficult thing to do after he stopped working in the past.
   <br/>
   “It was not to resign from fate.”
   <br/>
   It's about an hour or two of walking along a certain path.
