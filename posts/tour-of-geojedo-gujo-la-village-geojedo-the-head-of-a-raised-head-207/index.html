<title>Tour of Geojedo Gujo La Village. Geojedo, the head of a raised head - Geoje-si, Gyeongnam, Korea</title>





<meta name="description" content="Geojedo National Highway 14 is famous for its beautiful scenery. After passing Buksan Mountain and heading south to the sea, an impressive village appears. It is a gujo-la village that crosses the sea next to a land that looks as long as a giraffe&#39;s neck and thin like an ant&#39;s waist. There is a small mountain beyond the narrow and long town, so the impression that you want to look around is imminent. Entered the Gujo La Village as attracted by the strange charm. It&#39;s past winter, but the weather seems a bit winter, and it&#39;s too cold for spring, so it&#39;s the south side of the peninsula that shines. Jeju Island is fine, but Geoje Island is a good alternative when transportation is burdensome. It leads to Geoje Bridge, so it is easy to access and has a warm atmosphere. Beyond Geoje Bridge, you can enjoy the scenery of Namhae next to it. There are peaceful seas, islands with grains of grain, roofs gathered on the shores of fishing villages, and ships anchored in the harbor. Among them, the unique features of Geoje Island are the complex Rias coastline and the surrounding landscape. It has become monotonous with people&#39;s hands, but the coastline, which is infrequent in nature, can be seen with its intricate coastline.

    Geojedo National Highway 14 is famous for its beautiful scenery. After passing Buksan Mountain and heading south to the sea, an impressive village appears. It is a gujo-la village that crosses the sea next to a land that looks as long as a giraffe's neck and thin like an ant's waist.

    It's past winter, but the weather seems a bit winter, and it's too cold for spring, so it's the south side of the peninsula that shines. Jeju Island is fine, but Geoje Island is a good alternative when transportation is burdensome. It leads to Geoje Bridge, so it is easy to access and has a warm atmosphere.

  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    On the west side of Gujora Village, there is a fine sandy beach and a gentle curved beach, and on the east side is a port where ships anchor. This port has been used as a major base for maritime transportation in Japan since ancient times, and since it was designated as a national fishing port in 1971, it has a large port, such as Jang Seung-po, as well as a ballroom as a port. In addition, it has a high location as a tourist spot as it is possible to take a cruise ship through Naedo, Oedo, and Haegeum River, close to Gujora. In the daytime, don't miss the waves of the sea surfing in and out in the winter, and the night view of the harbor at night.

    There is a lot of anglers even though there is a strong winter breeze because the port breaks down and comes to the breakwater. It is said that Benedom is caught well, and various fish species such as horse mackerel and tochi are caught. A little further south along the coastline is a small pebble beach. And it is also the southern end of the sea where Crystal Mountain and the sea meet. You can see Naedo Island and Oedo Island in the distance. Just as the three sides of the Korean Peninsula are the sea, the structure is similar.

    The end of the road leads to the Sujeongsan Trail. There is no need for a guide as the breakwater, pebble beach, and crystal mountain line along the way from the port. If you just walk with the sea next to it, you will naturally go to every corner of Gujora Village. Crystal Mountain is a small mountain less than 150 meters above sea level, and is a mountain that rises before the southern veins of Buk Byeong Mountain in the north reach the sea. If it is Jinsan in Gujora Village, it will be Jinsan.

To take advantage of the seats, an observatory was installed, and there was a signboard with the name of the island in the foreground.

    The sea of the South Sea is more dazzling than summer. Even at noon, the sun and the dazzling sunshine of the sea are not too far from the horizon. When the cloudy clouds cover the sun, sunlight shining through the gaps of the clouds sits in the sea. The lumpy cloud doesn't have a moving tee if this place is good. Underneath, the sea and island scenery can be seen at a glance. I often describe the Namhae as my mother's arms, and it seems that the warmth is conveyed. It is as sweet as a movie because a fishing boat passes by in a landscape where the idea of 'it is really nature' passes through.

    30 minutes from guard post to summit is sufficient. If you look back while climbing the slope, the sea and islands spread out through the stiff branches of the winter mountain, so you don't feel hungry. There is also an observation deck at the summit of Mt. The sea is good to the south and the town is overlooking to the north.

    The structure of the village on the waist, which is concave up and down between Sujeong and Bukbyeongsan, and concave to the left and right, is nice. Since ancient times, Sujeongsan was called the head of Zara, and the narrow land was the tree of Zara. To the north, Buksan Mountain rises sharply as if it has fanned out from side to side. I think Gujora Village has a very good place.

    As you descend the ridge in front of the village, you will encounter the castle wall, the trace of Gujouraseong. This castle was built to prevent dwarfs from the Joseon Dynasty, and is one of the Geoje Chiljins constructed in the first year of Seongjong. After the Imjin War, it was moved to the side of Okpojin and then returned to its current location and was named Gujorajin and is now designated as 204 Gyeongsangnam-do Monument.

    When you reach the middle point between Sujeongsan and the village along the castle wall, there is one small island floating in the sea of Gujora Beach, called 'Yundol Island' and contains the legend of Hyoja's verses.
    <br/>
    "Once upon a time, a fisherman who had a family living with a beautiful woman named Haesun lived. One day, a sea fisherman who worked at the sea disappeared by a typhoon with a ship. After this day, the fisherman came out to the sea every night and called the sea boat every night and stared at the moon. Residents who watched this figure called the fisherman 'Mangwol'.
   </p>
   <p>
    At this time, the widow and three of his sons settled on an island called Yundol Island. The old fisherman and the widow who became widowers became soothing each other. The island where the widow lived was only able to walk to the village at low tide, and each time the widow visited the widower without her son's knowledge. Knowing these relationships, the sons of Yun made a stepping stone by placing stones between the island and the village because they felt sorry for their mother heading to the village even after taking off their socks and getting wet in the sea in winter.

    As the wall ends and the village approaches, a bamboo forest grows densely. What was created as a windbreak forest is now being used as a walking trail with a pretty name called the breeze. The leaves flutter in the sea breeze, and it becomes fine. There is a scary story that even in the summer, this place is cool and ghosts come out. The phrase “Boiso” by the residents about this place is impressive.
