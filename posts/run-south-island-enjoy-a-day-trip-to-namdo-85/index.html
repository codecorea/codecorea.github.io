   Take a trip to Namdo! Invincible bus, Namdo One Wheel
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The biggest reason for worrying about the trip to Namdo is the streets and traffic routes. Because of the relatively long distances, our journey to Namdo is once again considered. Also, since I went down to Iwang Namdo, would I not be filled with the desire to see things here and there? But unless you're a self-driving driver, there's too much information to be aware of in order to enjoy your trip across the region. You too far to be close, Namdo! There is a way to solve the worries about traveling to South Korea like a mirage! The main character is 'Jeonnam Tourist Bus, Namdo One Wheel'.

In particular, Yeosu 7 course (25,000 won, which includes a bus ticket to Geumdo Island) is very popular. Bus seats are also available. When purchased on-site, you are free to sit on a first-come, first-served basis for the remaining seats.

   The course consists of Suncheon Bay Reed Field, Nak-An Eupseong, Root Museum, Boseong Green Tea Field, and Jangheung Woodland. Stay around 1-2 hours at each destination. After all trips, get off at Suncheon Station and Suncheon Terminal. This means that you can fully enjoy your trip to South Korea by public transport. If you want to stay for another day, you can either stay near the station or go to Gwangju, where most of the Namdo buses depart. All courses except Suncheon 2 course depart from Gwangju. If you take Gwangju as a base camp, you will be able to enjoy abundant travel in Namdo using 'Hando'.

   The explanation of the cultural interpreter continues on the moving bus. The road to Suncheon Bay Reed Field (Suncheon Bay Natural Ecological Park) and Suncheon Bay International Garden Expo, which opened in 2013, also pass by. If the flower is in full bloom, don't forget to stay for another day and visit. Arrive at Suncheon Bay Reed Field in time. It is the largest reed colony in Korea. Tidal flat friends such as chubby and chilge greet people down the promenade. I would like to go up to the Yongsan Observatory, but the time allowed is about 1 hour and 20 minutes. I listened to the explanations and took pictures and walked up. If you want to go to the Yongsan Observatory where you can see the huge S-line of Suncheon Bay, you have to climb diligently from the beginning. This is because there is not enough time to walk slowly while listening to the explanation.
