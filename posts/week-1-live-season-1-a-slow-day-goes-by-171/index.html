   When my mom got angry when he was young, he didn't come out all day while wearing a futon in the corner. I only hid my body on a sheet of quilt, but I realized that I was blocked from the outside, and I cried alone and laughed, so I found peace. Namhae is like a blanket in those days. The scenery is beautiful, the surroundings are calm, and the people are slow. Is it a place to hide me in a noisy world? At the moment of crossing the Namhae Bridge, it seems that the worries and worries that constantly rush away are falling apart.

  <div class="txt_p">
   So I arrived at Pyeongsan-ri. It is a small and pretty village with houses overlooking the indigo South Sea. Pyeongsan Port, the starting point of “Daeggi Jiget-gil,” is located in the Namhae wish road. Although it is far from famous tourist spots such as German village, Darangi village, and Boriam, young people who are drunk in secluded charm may stay like locals for days.

   A good-hearted boss provides delicious coffee for free to guests. This is because the skills of the boss and the couple who lived in Japan and Spain and went to many famous cafes in the country were melted. Drip coffee, which is sold for a fee, will be provided in the near future. The tasting was done in advance because it was roasted in Melbourne, so it was definitely different from the bitter or thin franchise coffee I've eaten so far. It is fragrant and savory, and you can feel acidity at the end. In order to import these beans, it is necessary to meet very demanding conditions, such as having stable demand or having suitable extraction equipment. Still, the boss does not neglect the preparation. A cup of well-made coffee will be a good friend for travelers who read books.

   On the second day, I decided to take a walk in the village on a sunny day. There is no brochure or town map, so the path is decided entirely by your own choice. First, I moved to the hill.

Garlic crusts are often found in the cowshed on one side of the house. One of the famous things in the South Sea is a herd raised with garlic, and it is often grown in households, not in large houses.

   After looking around slowly, it was time to eat. I didn't see any convenience stores, cafes, restaurants, etc., so I asked the president of the guest house to recommend it. The first restaurant I visited is the Juran Restaurant on Nam-myeon, about 4 km from the village. Unlike the gorgeous yellow-green color appearance, this is a place where the Gyeongsang-do white porcelain is simply prepared. If you order a set meal of 8,000 won, you will be served a tray full of 12 side dishes, including soup, in hot rice. Some side dishes change every day, but basically they are filled with things that are commonly eaten at home, such as kimchi, herbs, cucumbers, fish, and pickles. Among them, my hands went the most to Hwangtae-muchim, crispy and light-fried Seodae-gui, and savory crab miso soup.

   We decided to settle the evening at Pyeongsan Sashimi Restaurant located in Pyeongsan Port. Although it has been mentioned several times in the guestbook, it was also because I was curious about the taste of the seafood in the Namhae after seeing the liveliness of the Pyeongsan Top Market in the morning. On the signboard, it was written, “I caught the uncle, cut the aunt, and specialized in fishing meat. The water sashimi I tasted here was delicious enough to be picked up. For me who can't eat dog fire, sea squirt, sea cucumber, etc., I have no choice but to be moved by a simple water sashimi flavored with natural flounder, fresh vegetables, and spicy grass. The thick, thinly sliced fish meat was chewy and soft, so it went well with rice. Even though it is water sashimi, the seasoning that is close enough to the bibim sashimi is a taste. Among tourists, hoe-donbap, which serves a small spicy hot pot, is popular, but when the summer tastes cool, water sashimi is also a good choice.

    After eating dinner, I thought of an anti-inflammatory agent that I decided to buy a few days ago. Again, when I asked the guesthouse president about the location of the pharmacy, he told me that there was a pharmacy near 5:30 pm near Juran Restaurant. Should I get out of the car again? I felt like I was running out of time, so I stepped on Excel on the back road.
