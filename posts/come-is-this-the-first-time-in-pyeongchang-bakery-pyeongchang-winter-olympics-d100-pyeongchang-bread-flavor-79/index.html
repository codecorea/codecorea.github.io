   Penny always enjoys trekking in Canada. A naturalist and healthist, she is a vegetarian who likes to walk in the mountains. It is the most vegan of any vegetarian diet. Vegan doesn't eat meat, or dairy products like eggs, milk, and cheese. I found the perfect place for her. It is 'Nanda Bakery' located in Odaesan Woljeongsa. Since it is a temple operated by thorough vegetarianism. Do not use butter, milk or eggs at all. Organic wheat flour and domestic whole wheat are used, and other ingredients are selected with domestic priority.

   Nanda and bakery bread is made tricky. First of all, it is operated by a large temple called Woljeongsa Temple. Since the monk must be edible bread, it is based on the principle of temple food. Make bread that is beneficial to your body rather than deceptive bread and focus on honest and healthy tastes rather than profits. The bread maker also puts healthy bread first. He has been in the baking industry for a long time, and he is more sensitive to bread ingredients because he suffers from atopy and skin allergies. Also his wife is vegan. As the couple make bread that they can eat, they are bound to be more thorough.

   Nandana Bakery is simple. Not many kinds of bread come out in one day. The bread is not gorgeous either. The ingredients for bread are also simple. Release materials one by one with confidence. The bread is more faithful to the inside than the outer packaging. You can see just one soboro bread. There are many hands, but you can also make toppings with sobo. Mix ground peanut and pistachios with coconut oil. It's very different from ordinary soboro bread toppings made with butter, peanut butter, sugar and eggs.

   This is the case for all breads in Nanda and Bakery. Healthy and delicious breads, such as cakes made with vegetarian cream, home-grown red beans and red bean bread made from fermented yeast. Next to the bakery is a cafe and a cafe. You can buy bread and eat it with a drink at a tea house or cafe. The fine mountain landscape is a bonus.

   Type B: Ski enthusiasts &amp; local food lovers → Corobay
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Caroline is a skier. I live in Vancouver, but in winter, I live in a family cottage in Whistler. She is also a local food lover. The reason she was forced to become a local food lover was because of global warming. Feeling that Canada's winter has been changing for some time, she began to do small things she could do to prevent global warming, and one of them is local food. Local food is not only good for health by consuming fresh local produce, but it also has a positive impact on the environment as it reduces food miles (the distance from which produce is brought to the consumer's table) to reduce CO2 emissions.

   Bread buckwheat is run by a sibling from Pyeongchang and, as the name implies, uses 100% domestic buckwheat. In Pyeongchang and Jeju Island, I am buckwheat. Choi Hyo-ju, the baker's president, got a buckwheat bread idea from a friend from Canada a few years ago. When a Canadian friend stayed in Korea and went home, he wanted to buy buckwheat, a specialty of Pyeongchang. If you take buckwheat alone, food utilization will decrease. Seeing a friend's favorite buckwheat cookies are also delicious, I decided to make bread with buckwheat, a local specialty.
