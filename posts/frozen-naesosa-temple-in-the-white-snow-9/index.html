    A trip to the West Sea, where you can see everything at sunrise and sunset, becomes even more abundant in winter. Is it thanks to the seasonal foods? Is it the power of white snow? One winter, during the heavy snowfall of the West Coast, I visited Buan Byeonsan Peninsula, the pearl of the West Sea. I missed the winter landscape of the Naesosa fir forest road and the arid seasons of the Reddish River and the Quarry River.

   According to records such as Dongguk Yeoji Seungram, Naesosa's original name was 'Sorae-sa (蘇 來 寺)'. It has been said that it was named “Naso” because the Chinese Tang Dynasty Chang-Sang Jeong-bang was established. After one week, the path leads to Cheonwangmun and a fir forest path that introduces Nao Sosa Temple, which is more than a thousand years old.

    After exiting Naesosa, climb National Route 30 and you will soon reach Gomso. Gomso has been famous for salt pans since ancient times. Gyehwabeol was the main production area, but during World War II, it became a land by constructing roads and building dikes linking the interlocking villages with Hodo (Bumseom), Ungyeon Island, and Sokdo during the end of the Japanese War. As such, the 45 hectares of Gomin-so-jeon are located in Gomso Port. The annual salt production boasts 2500 tons. Let's take a quick look at the signboard at the beginning of Gom Gomin.

    Gomso's specialty is salt. In the past, salt was so important that it was managed by the state and must not have been sold until recently. One of the things to take to the king's refuge was salt. While man is necessary to live… (syncopation)… The production of salt in Buan was mainly flame, and the area of Gyehwa Daeverly was the main production area. Gomso's good salt taste makes fermented foods such as Gomso Salted Fish, Soybean Soybean Paste, and Cinnamic Bamboo Salt, a specialty.

    Gomson solar salt is produced from March to the end of October. You can get salt every summer and every 3 to 5 days in spring and autumn. Summer salt is large in crystals and small in crystals but hard in autumn. Gommon sun salt has little bitter taste because it is not used when the concentration of liver water becomes dark.
   </p>
   <p>
    I found Gomso salt field before dawn. The snow is still piled up due to the heavy snow on the west coast, which has not yet wakened up from the dark. It is not cloudy and the sun does not appear. Instead, I could see the Gomyeojeonjeon waking up. Slowly dark goes Instead of salt, the snowflake sits on top of the salt pan and shines. Except for the winter, you can also enjoy the Gomyeo salt preservation experience.
