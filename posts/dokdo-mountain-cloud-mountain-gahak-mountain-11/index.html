   In Gwangmyeong-si, there is an elongated mountain path that runs from north to south. It is Jongju-gil, Gwangmyeong-si, which extends from Mt. Dodeok to Mt. Cloud, Gahak-san and Seodok. All are low mountains with an altitude of over 200m.

    There is a Cloud Mountain Tunnel on the way down from Mt. Next to it is a night town with a special food culture street. There are a variety of restaurants, including Western and Korean food. Some of them are already recognized as gourmet, and many people come to hear the rumors. If you think of the schedule up to the foot of the West Doksan mountain, it is good to go down Dokdeok Mountain and enjoy a meal at night village. In the village of Ante, which is next to the village at night, there is an Ante Ecological Park, which is home to a native flower garden, ecological water purification media, and an ecological forest. Cloud Mountain is located in the center of Gwangmyeong-si and is 237m high and is the highest among the mountains in Gwangmyeong-si. The mountain in the former name Avanturi was called Abangbong, but it was called Mt. The Cloud Mountain Road has several trails. Depending on the course, you can walk a wide range of 8km long and 1km short. The road that leads directly to the summit of Mt.

   It's not as high as the name says, but the cloud forest is very cozy. The forest became more dense since it was established as an environmental forest in 2013. As you head to the summit, the noise on the road gradually diminishes, and the lush forest relaxes you like any landscape in the highlands. The charm of Cloud Mountain is that the road is quiet and you can walk quietly and leisurely. In the middle of the easy road, the middle mountain is a mountain. It is not a very steep or very dangerous route, but it is always necessary to step on fallen leaves and finely-grained soil.

   Even in the cold winter winds, whenever a drop of sweat on the forehead creates a peregrine vertebra, a shelter with a wooden chair emerges. It's a low mountain, so it's a good idea to take a short break when you start breathing. There are several springs around the mountain. There are seven hiking trails that lead to the summit of Mt. Cloud, which passes different springs along the way, but all are certified as drinking water by water quality test. It is safe and the taste of water is constant so that the people's footsteps can not stop in the morning.

It is hard to come to the temple, stop and look up at the sky, and you can see the roof of Unsanjeong on the summit. Even though this moment is the hardest in the world, it always passes in the blink of an eye. The view below the mountain is different from Mt. The cloud sperm seems to rise to the top like a lighthouse at the top of the island, while the morality is in the middle of it.

    Gahak-san is 220m above sea level, about 20m lower than cloud mountain. On the other hand, the distance is 2.5km and the course is long. It can be seen without walking that the road from the summit of Mt. Military units are located on the Gadaksan Mountain and further west of the mountain. A barbed wire runs from the cloud to the other side of the road. There is a no-access zone, so use the designated hiking trails.
