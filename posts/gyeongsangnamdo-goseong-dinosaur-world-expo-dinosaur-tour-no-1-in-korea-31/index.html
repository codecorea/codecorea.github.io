   'Dinosaur Country' will be held in Gyeongsangnam-do Goseong for 12 days from June 12 to '2016 Gyeongnam Goseong Dinosaur World Expo'. The expo, which celebrated the 4th time, was held under the theme of `` Dinosaurs, opening the future with a light of hope, '' so the nightly remodeling has more attractions than the previous event. Let's go to Goseong to find dinosaurs who were owners of this land 100 million years ago.

   Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Seymosus… '. These are the names you've heard once. If those names are difficult, you may want to think of a comic cartoon, Baby Dinosaur Dooly. As a child, we once met 'they'. Dinosaurs have been the host of the earth for about 160 million years. How exciting would it be if you could meet the dinosaurs you met in a movie or a book?

  <strong class="ar_title">
   Why did Gyeongnam Goseong become a dinosaur country?
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   I wonder in this passage. How did Gyeongnam Goseong become a 'dinosaur country'? It starts off at the coast of Deokmyeong-ri, Hai-myeon, known as Sangamam County Park. In 1982, the first dinosaur footprint was found here. In the course of the investigation, a fossil dinosaur egg came out. Deokmyung-ri Dinosaur Footprint Fossil Mountain, where dinosaur footprints were found in groups, was selected as a Natural Monument (411). Where is it? In 1999, fossil dinosaur footprints were found near Goseong IC in Maam-myeon during the construction of Daejeon Tongyeong Expressway.

   As many as 5,000 footprints are scattered all over Goseong. Of course, the possibility of further excavation cannot be excluded. This is why Goseong is nicknamed 'dinosaur country'. Perhaps Goseong was the center of the Korean Peninsula in the dinosaur age. Thanks to the overflowing traces of dinosaurs, Gyeongnam Goseong is considered to be the fossil producing region of the world's three largest dinosaur footprints, along with Colorado, USA and the west coast of Argentina.

   The world-famous 'Dinosaur Country' Goseong started the 'Gyeongnam Goseong Dinosaur World Expo' for the first time in 2006. It was to make it easier and more fun to inform the public about this space of great academic value. The expo, held every three to four years, celebrates four times this year. From the birth of the earth to the dinosaurs' global environment and the life of dinosaurs, there are many programs that can be enjoyed and learned by young children.

   Now, let's go on a dinosaur trip around Goseong Dinosaur World Expo. Goseong's representative dinosaur destination can be classified into two places. Danghangpo area, where the dinosaur expo main stage is located, and foot rock area where dinosaur footprints were first discovered. Of course, there are dinosaur fossils scattered all over the place, but if you travel around these two places, you can dive into the traces of dinosaurs that used to play in Goseong.

   It takes about 20 minutes from Goseong IC to Danghangpo, the main stage of the expo. If you go to Danghangpo tourist spot and search for 'Parking Lot 1', 'Dinosaur's Gate' or 'Danghangpo Auto Camping Ground', it's fast. When you enter the dinosaur's door, you will be greeted by a dinosaur fountain. One of the most famous dinosaurs is the tyrannosaurus. The dinosaur garden stretched out behind it is literally full of dinosaurs.

   If you find the Danghangpo where the dinosaur expo spreads, you can also visit the dinosaur footprints left in the small old school building. It will take about 30 minutes along Route 77, which has been selected as 'Beautiful Road in Korea'. You should see the roadside signs. It's not easy to find on the way, but it's fun to see the footprints of dinosaurs that might have played on this land someday. The owner of a giant footprint over 30cm is estimated to be a giant sauropod that ranges from 110 to 120m.
