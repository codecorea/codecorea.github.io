   Namwon is old-fashioned and elegant. The scent of tradition is evident. Gwanghalluwon is at the center. Namwon is also the hometown of Dongpyeonje, which is evaluated as the 'Voice of Folklore'. That's why we can hear our friendly melody all over Namwon. Above all, Namwon sits leaning against the generous and magnificent Jiri Mountain, and the mountain stream is clear and green. Bamsagol Valley and Silsangsa Temple are places where you can soak up the summer landscape of Jirisan Mountain.

   Although it is not a long trail, a gentle sloped deck road is closely attached to the valley, so the sound of water is close and the noise is far. Another advantage is that you can enjoy a cool walk in the middle of the summer with a variety of broad-leaved trees.
   <u>
    However, in general, the slope is gentle, but some sections are a little steep.
   </u>
   In the middle of the beautiful scenery, there is also an observation deck overlooking the valley. Directly below the wheelchair, the jade-colored cow shines and the eyes are cool. Toilets for the disabled are located in front of the Ban Seon Bridge and inside the Bamsagol Exploration Center, and parking spaces for the disabled are provided in the visitor center.

   Another name for the Snake Valley is 'Dolgolgol'. This means that the valley water will bend and return. The sound of the valley water is so loud. Occasionally, the sound of valley water flowing through a cool stream adds to the sound of wind passing through a broad-leaved tree, and is accompanied by a fine bird sound. The fact that the sound of the water near the cow and the sound of the valley passing through the large and small rocks are slightly different is also known by the valley near the trail.

   Flat Garam, Real Sergeant Carefully Considering Wheelchair Access

  <div class="txt_p">
   Actually, Sangsangsa is a rare flat land in Korea. Located in the middle of a field near the village, it is called 'Sanjeol', 'Village', and 'Deuljeol'. The grounds are so spacious that the grounds are stiff, and Bo Gwang-jeon, the center of Garam, is unpretentious by revealing bare skin without a single measure. So, at first glance, it is thought that there is nothing to see. However, if you know, the real world is a treasure complex. There are 1 national treasure and 11 treasures. As a single temple, it has the largest number of national treasure-class cultural properties in Korea.

   In reality, there are a lot of sounds. As it is not a temple located deep in the mountains, the sound of private houses and fields easily surpasses despair. It is also attractive to be able to immerse yourself in meditation while listening to the sound of beating bells in the sun. In the summer, the evening service starts at 7 pm. It's nice to sit under an old tree behind Myeongbujeon and listen to the serene and majestic ringing bell. On a windy day, the scenery cries all over the place. It is also a different experience to feel the texture of temple cultural properties by tracing the patterns engraved on stone lanterns or stone pagoda by hand.

   The sacred place of Gugak is a travel destination that can be enjoyed not only by the eyes but also by the ears. As soon as you enter the exhibition room (the braille block is installed at the entrance), the gayageum melody is automatically played, and there are traditional musical instruments that you can play directly around the exhibition room. If you are lucky, you can also listen to the sound of masters practicing pansori in the open air room (the place where you drill a hole in the mountain to practice pansori).
