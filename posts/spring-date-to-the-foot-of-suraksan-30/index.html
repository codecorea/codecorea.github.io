    As spring approaches, we have a date course where you can take a gentle walk and a cup of hot coffee. When we say 'mountain', we often think of 'Hasanju', but if it's the same time as the spring breeze is blowing, wouldn't it be better to add 'tea' instead of 'sake'? I left the early spring outing with a walk and a cup of tea at Suaksan Mountain located in Uijeongbu and Nowon-gu, Gyeonggi-do.
   </p>
   <p>
    Located between Sanggye-dong, Nowon-gu, Seoul, and Uijeongbu-si, Gyeonggi-do, Suraksan (638m) is a mountain that is beloved by citizens along with Bukhansan, Dobongsan, and Bulamsan. The seemingly muscular rock walls may make hiking a burden, but pickling is not so harsh. Professional mountaineers can enjoy hiking in the mountains of Bulam ~ Suraksan ~ Dobongsan ~ Bukhansan, but it is enough to enjoy one by one.
   </p>

  <div class="txt_p">
   Suraksan trekking can be started at Danggo Open Station, Suraksan Station, and Mangwol Station. Today, I plan to add a cup of hot tea after a gentle spring walk, so I headed to Suraksan station where some pretty cafes are gathered. The trekking course is Cheonsang Byeong-gil, which connects to the entrance of Nowongol, Nogungol Yaksu, Nobungol Crossroads, Dosolbong, and Summit. Of course, you don't necessarily have to go to the top. A walk is enough. It still enters a mountain path with cold wind.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    The light is over, but the trees are bare and the ground is frozen. Still, the spring energy is mixed with 2% and it is exciting. Even on weekdays, those who visited the mountain are quite visible. The colorful attire of the hikers illuminates the achromatic mountains that have not yet been replaced with spring clothes.

   After taking the walk in Suraksan, I started to explore the cafe street. The longer the stay in the mountain, the higher the chance that the tea would turn into sake. The entrance to Nowakgol in Suraksan is a residential space that combines apartments, villas and detached houses. Various restaurants, cafes, and climbing equipment stores fill the streets between Nowongol Avenue and residential spaces.

   When you descend from the mountain to the plain, you will find a variety of restaurants. The fun that is different from the fun in the mountains begins now. Just a few years ago, the number of climbing equipment stores that filled this place, along with restaurants, was noticeably reduced.

The sea and coffee go well together, but there weren't many cafes in the mountains. There were many homes where I could add Hassan. Then as more and more coffee shoppers entered the cafe. There are more people who want to take a break and have a cup of tea in the airy foothills. I still have many locals, lovers on a date and friends to talk. ”

The taste of the lunch on the mountain can't be followed. Why don't you take a light stroll, visit a delicious cafe, and enjoy the upcoming spring with a good person? Sit side by side at the cafe and share a cherry blossom song. Spring, welcome!
