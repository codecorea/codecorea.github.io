   The Yoseonam Rock Grotto in Mureung-ri, Suju-myeon was designated as a natural monument in April. The cleft hole is well-known as a 'pot hole', and is also called a hemoptysis. It is caused by vortices that flow as the water swirls in the concave area of the rock. As the sand or gravel swirls along with the water, the topography that develops due to the wear of the rock is the pit.

    Mureung-ri Yoseonam rock opening is located at the point where the streams of Jucheon River originating from Taegisan, which forms the boundary between Pyeongchang, Hoengseong, and Hongcheon, and Beopheung Valley originating from Mt. There is a large rock called Yoseonam, which is a large granite rock by the river. Along with Anpyeong-daegun, Kim-gu, and Han-ho, Bongrae Yangseon, who was called as the 4th calligrapher of the Joseon Dynasty, stayed with Pyeongchang-gun, contrary to the scenery here, meaning the word 'yoseonam (암)', meaning 'where the new ship was flying' I lost, and the name came from there.

    You can easily find the stone hole if you find Yoseonjeong or Mt. In the past, you could drive to Maitreyaam, but now you have to park your car at the entrance to Maitreyaam and walk. After walking about 200m along a low mountain with Yoseonjeong, you can see Mireukam. Standing on a small stone staircase descending from Mireukam to the river, a rock with a stone hole quickly reveals its appearance. Looking at Yoseonam from Gilmok, the graceful curves of the rock created by the water and the time come into sight. The closer you get to the rock, the more pronounced the curve of the rock.

    No matter how hard a person struggles, it is difficult to live for 100 years. In order to make a hole, a person's life span needs to be multiplied by hundreds or even thousands of times, even if the human life span is 100 years. Since many times and streams of water have been made by touching and trimming natural granite plates, they are once surprised by the time of frighteningness, and once again endured by the appearance of the stone hole that is now in its shape. It's been a long time since it was raining, but it's somewhat dry and rough, but it's hard to keep an eye out for the smooth curves of the rock. It draws a curve as if it were a wave, and a thick cylindrical shape as if a giant weapon passed. Ms. Pongrae Yang Saeon's life would have had this opening. Naturally, freshness seemed to be in his eyes.

   Meet the beautiful scenery of the Jucheon River, Yo Seonjeong
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    After looking around Yoseonam, be sure to visit Yoseonjeong. Yoseonjeong is at the top of a low mountain behind Mireukam. It takes less than 5 minutes to climb along a pretty trail with a sprawling pine tree lined up. In a fairly spacious space, Yo Seon-jeong, Maae-bul, and a small stone pagoda that lost my shape are guarded.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    It is said that this place was originally a small hermitage attached to Beopheungsa Temple. Yo Seonjeong is a small pavilion with 2 spaces on the front and 2 spaces on the side. In 1915, during the Japanese colonial rule, the Yoseon-gyewons were founded in the center to seal Sukjong's yesterday. Sukjong's yesterday's poem was originally hung in Cheongheru, Jucheon, and was destroyed by fire. Later, after King Sukjong, Yeongjo, who was immediately found out, wrote and rewrote Sukjong's yesterday's poems, and then gave the sum. It is said that Jeongjo, who succeeded Yeongjo, also lowered the amount of money yesterday and walked to Cheongheru. During the Japanese colonial rule, when Cheong Heo-ru fell and the lumps in the hand fell into the hands of the Japanese, the stocks of Jucheon's retainers repurchased the lumps and enshrined them in the yard. In Yeonseonjeong, Yeongjo wrote yesterday's King Sukjong and King Jeongjo's yesterday.

  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   If you go up the Bheungheung Valley, you will meet the historic temple of Bongheungsa Temple under Mt. Beopheungsa Temple is one of the top temples of the Lion Mountain Gate among the Gusan Seonmun and one of the top five extinction palaces in Korea that enshrines the Buddha's truth. Gusan Seonmun and Jeokjeombogung have common features that are typical mountain temples located in the middle of rare mountains. This is because the temples of the unified Shilla Dynasty and the Sunjong, which emphasized self-discipline, were largely built, and temples were built in the mountains far away from the world. Beopheungsa Temple was built in the middle of the mountain, which is blocked by the mountain of Saja and is no longer connected. Nevertheless, the Buddhist temple pilgrimage continues, creating a strange contrast.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Beopheungsa remains the only cultural property designated as a treasure in Yeongwol. That is Yeongwol Heungnyeongsaji Jinghyo Ambassador Monument (Treasure No. 612). This is a monument engraved on the hall from Ambassador Jing Hyo-nyeong's birth to enrollment. Isu, the headstone, and the head of a dragon-shaped abdomen and inscription remain intact. On the lower hill, there is also the Jing Hyo-guksabu, which is dedicated to Ambassador Jing Hyo's saree.

    The path to the Eruption Bogung is breathtakingly breathtaking, but a huge cluster of red pine leaves the eyes to the fullest. Declining your neck with a mineral water and climbing around the mother's labyrinth, you quickly reach the extinction palace. Since he had a Jinsinsari, there is a low hill with no Buddha statues, and low hills and mountainous hills surrounding him. It is said that Jinsinsari was brought somewhere in the mountain. Only the tomb-shaped crypt and broken stone that Jajangyulsa has devoted the capital replace the old story.

    These days, it is getting hot and steaming, and I miss the cool and relaxing prices. Don't be satisfied just by looking around Beopheungsa and enjoy the Tak people in the surrounding valley. The streams starting from the foot of Mt. Gubong and Mt. Baekdeok on the left and right of Mt. The small valley that flows next to Beopheungsa Temple is perfect for enjoying the Tak people. Beopheung Valley from Yoseonjeong to Beopheungsa Temple is not only great for playing in the water, but it also has a camping site, so it's easy to relax.
