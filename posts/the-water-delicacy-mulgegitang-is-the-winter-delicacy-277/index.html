    In winter, a special visitor comes to the fishing of the fishermen of Geoje Island. It is a guy called ‘meetchi’ or ‘water catfish’ that climbed from the deep sea to the coast during the spawning season from December to March. It is said that the water catfish was also called the 'water term bun.' This is because when fish were caught, it was thrown into the sea, and the sound of “tumbang” sounded. It would be difficult for anyone who tasted the charm of water catfish to accept this myth.

    There are many sashimi restaurants and restaurants alongside Gujo-La Village's port and sea. The seasonal water catfish is having a short life in an aquarium. It looks like a soccer player's calf and a large body like a calf and a wide mouth like a catfish, but the eyes are so small ... If he is hungry, he eats the eggs of his own people, but he may not have been able to tell if they are eggs. When I take a picture and see it on a small camera screen, it looks like a tadpole. I am curious about the taste this fish will show.

    At least one piece of ‘Water Catfish Tang’ was written around the signboard. This is because water catfish is not a species caught throughout the four seasons. I entered a house and ordered a water catfish soup.

    If Geojedo is also a festival in Daegu, I asked the owner. “Which is better, Daegu-tang or Mulgi-tang?” “Daegu-tang is delicious, and water catfish-tang is also delicious. My home's Daegu-tang is more delicious. Did you come alone as you became more comfortable, and where did you come from? Questions are poured out one after another. And he willingly accepts the cooperation.

    When he pulls out the guy who had attached the scaffold to the glass of the aquarium, it flickers twice, but the owner's arm is strong enough to shake. The freshness of water catfish is important because Geoje's water catfish soup is cooked clearly without kimchi or red pepper powder.

    Place a water catfish on a cutting board with a concave in the middle, and start cleaning. The sheath is cut between the head and the torso and peeled off in an instant to reveal translucent white skin. It is said that a strong water like jelly is a characteristic of a live water catfish.

    There is no time or gap in adding a few pieces of chopped garlic, onion, green onion, and red pepper. Mulgi-tang, which boils clearly, is common, but in some parts of the East Sea, ripe kimchi is added to make it. The owner, who put all the ingredients and kicked the foam with a ladle, said, "Would you like to drink some journalist?" I was wondering if I was asked a lot of questions, but it is the moment when Mulgi-tang is the most delicious time to eat when the stomach is empty due to excessive drinking the day before.

    The more you know the relationship between water catfish and alcohol, the more interesting it is. It is difficult to eat the circuit because the water catfish is tender. So, water catfish is semi-dried and eaten, which is perfect for a drink. He is a “bottle and give” guy who raises water catfish and drinks and soothes them later. For example, in Gangwon-do, if you say that mulmegi-tang is not delicious, you will hear a word saying, "I'm still drunk."

   A water statue boiled on a weak fire and a Hansang with a Chan of Geoje in Gyeongnam were served. After taking the water catfish soup out once with a ladle, the fins and bones are applied, so the white and plump flesh is easy to eat. I pick it up with chopsticks, but it quickly breaks. Scooped the ingredients and flesh with a spoon and asked a bite.

    A little unfamiliar texture and taste makes the exclamation, but there is no point that remains impressive. There is no fishy feeling, and a slight knives with a few slices of pepper is left in the aftertaste. It's like knowing why it boils clearly and sticks to fresh, live fish. In order to preserve the unique taste of water catfish, the seasoning had to be minimized. Subsequently, as I ate it, sweat began to form on my forehead, and the warmth of my body turned into a pleasant feeling. I could see the reason why Mulgi-tang is famous for its cool taste.

    The pot quickly turned empty while eating without chewing several times. The feeling of satiety is not very large compared to the amount eaten. However, the soup in the pot that is left empty is not empty. The broth is full of crumbly water and peculiar flavor. Sprinkle the broth and roll with rice. If you want to taste a little flat, add kimchi or red pepper powder, and two bowls of rice are ready to eat.

    Although this cool taste is attractive, it seems that fish called water catfish and food called water catfish aren't caught up in the popular food market. A while ago, a performer spit out the word ‘mechi-chi’ in an entertainment program, and a situation was broadcast to find out if this is actually a fish. The water texture and the peculiar texture of the water catfish act as a rejection for some people. When this reporter was young, he liked the soup, but he couldn't eat it easily. Then the adult around said, "I am still young and I don't know the taste." And it's one of my favorite baths I can't eat right now

    According to the owner, the yield of water catfish decreases every year. On the other hand, the number of foreigners looking for Mulgi-tang is increasing. . Increasingly, you can't believe the story that delicious fish has been called Multembang in the past.
