   In the vicinity of Gaetae Temple, which was founded under the name of Wang Geon, there is a Jisan Farm where you can meet the five worlds of Yeonhwa Hwaak-ri, one of the natural monuments. Among the natural monuments in Korea, there are livestock animals that are kept and managed in the hands of humans, and all six species, including Jeju black cattle, are designated as natural monuments this year. This is a livestock animal designated as a natural monument along with Jindo dog (No. 53), Jindo dog (No. 53), Jeju Jeju (No. 347), Gyeongsan spade dog (No. 368), and Gyeonggyeong dog Donggyeongi (No. 540). .

   The five chickens of Yeonhwa Hwaak-ri were recognized as typical Korean chickens and were designated as a natural monument No. 265 in 1980. Chickens were originally known to have entered South Korea from Southeast Asia via China. Although the inflow route is not well known, it is considered to have been indigenous to the present state after entering Korea. The appearance of the five worlds in the literature is the collection of ‘Jejeongjip’ by Jeong Dal-chong, the late Koryo tattoo. It is also said that after the reign of King Sukjong in Joseon and regained his health, he became a true product in the Chungcheong area. The closest record is that Hyung-Hum Lee of the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs in Jinsan was told to Cheoljong. Hyung-Hum Lee is the fifth grandfather of Seung-Sook Lee, CEO of Jisan Farm, a designated breeder of Oggy.

   The five worlds are clearly confused with the five worlds, although they are clearly different from the most commonly known. The Ogol system is a natural monument of Japan, and the hair is white while the bone is black and is called Ogol system. Introducing Oggy in the 1936 Dong-A Ilbo during the Japanese colonial period, it is still known that it was called Ogol Gye and confused. Korean native chickens are not Ogol, but Oggy. When Yoo Hong-jun was the director of the Cultural Heritage Administration, the name changed from Ogol-gye to Ogye-gye.

   The five worlds of Yeonhwahwa-ri have unique characteristics. First of all, not only the appearance, but also the bones are black. In Donguibogam, Geumsu edition, it is said that when a chicken's eyes are black, the bones are necessarily black. In addition to the hair, the five worlds are black with feet, crests, pupils and brows, skin and bones. If you look at it quietly, even though the whole is black, there is a bluish energy, but the color is very beautiful and subtle.

   The five worlds are sensitive and demanding enough to be close to wild birds. It is said that if kept in captivity, it is difficult to keep it because it can cause stress and death. Moreover, the growth rate is about 5 times slower than that of ordinary chickens, and the five chickens lay one every four to five days compared to the chickens that lay eggs one day. Although he is small and has good activity, he said in a saying, “A guy with a small body doesn't gain weight after running around. As a result, the five worlds are less economical. In the 1970s, with the introduction of poultry, the five worlds gradually began to culminate.

   Oggy was designated as a natural monument in 1980. In the designation of the natural monument, it was said to be "to prevent the extinction of the Ogol system, a rare livestock animal in Korea." It was said that there were only a few remaining even when it was designated as a natural monument. Oggy has been raised and managed for over 30 years in two generations since it was designated as a natural monument. It was difficult because the breeding was difficult and there was no support.

   The most dangerous for group breeding animals is an epidemic. In particular, avian influenza (AI) is the most terrifying disease for the five worlds. This is because 1,000 predators, designated as natural monuments, can be exterminated at once. So, in the past few years, such as 2006 and 2008, the evacuation procession of the five worlds continued to Dongducheon, Gyeonggi-do, Muuido, Incheon, and Bonghwa and Sangju, Gyeongbuk. In 2012, the five worlds that had to go to evacuation were also bound by local governments' backlash.

   In the stepmother's happy meal, it is divided into the general five and the five o'clock, and the soup is cooked. It is more accurate to say that it is a medicine rather than a food. The five worlds are divided into two categories: Oja chicken (Oggy rooster) and Oung chicken (Oggy hen) in ‘Geumsu’ of 《Donguibogam》 《Tang liquid edition》. According to the contents, the oggy is warm, sweet, and has no poison, so it makes the fetus comfortable, reports weakened postpartum, and gives good milking, making it especially good for pregnant women and mothers.
