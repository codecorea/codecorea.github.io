   Sinan is a country on the island. The island is composed of 1,004 islands, including 72 manned islands and 932 uninhabited islands. Among the countless islands as the stars in the night sky, the dark attitude is attracting attention among campers. This is because the Mongdol Sea Campground, which is popular with camping families, is located on the island.
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Mongdol Sea Campground is different from the journey. First, put a tent and body on the boat. And he goes through the scenery of the archipelago. Even if you are overwhelmed, you will leave the Songgong Dock and travel for about 25 minutes. 5 minutes drive from the marina to the camping grounds. Along the way, the landscape of the nostalgic island spreads out. It is accompanied by a salt field with the sun's passion and a tidal flat engraved with an S-shaped waterway. Beyond the salt fields and tidal flats, these islands cast shadows.

   The Mongdol Sea Campground is more commonly referred to as the "Monba". Mongba is also a short word for Mongdolsea, but it is a compound word of dream “mont” and the adverb “bar” which means “can” in German. In other words, “夢 bar” means you can dream. It is a camping ground where people dream and they want to be a camping ground where people can design their dreams and go back.

   Happiness to enjoy four islands at once

   Dark attitude is also the starting point for island trips. Four islands are connected by bridges: Amtaedo, Jaeundo, Palgeumdo, and Anzado. You can enjoy all these islands by boat. Crossing Eunam Bridge is Jaeundo. Jaeundo, which means “kind and gracious,” has picturesque beaches running along the island. Particularly popular are the sloping beaches with gentle slopes, lush pine forests, white sandy beaches with white sand beaches, and dune villages where you can experience lily digging and frying nets.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Amtaedo finds a lot of Chupo beach. The 2.5km outcrop that appears at low tide is a landmark of Chupo. Both sides run out of the outcrop. Crossing Jungang Bridge to the south from Amtaedo leads to Palgumdo. There is a three story stone pagoda at the entrance of Eupri village, located in Palgeum-myeon. It is believed to be a pagoda of the Koryo Dynasty, and a small island is approaching greatly in the face of more than a thousand years.

    The boat going to Amtaedo operates from 7:00 am to 7:50 pm every hour. If you take a car with you, line up the car first, following the sign for Amtaedo, and call the car number to go to the ticket. You must bring your ID. If you have a lot of cars to board, you have to wait a few hours, so it is best to use the boat early. The fare is 3,300 won each way, and the fare for passenger cars is 15,000 won (inquiry: Sinan Agricultural Cooperative Ticket Office 061-271-0090). Currently, a new millennium bridge that connects Abroad and Amtaedo is under construction to be completed in 2018.
