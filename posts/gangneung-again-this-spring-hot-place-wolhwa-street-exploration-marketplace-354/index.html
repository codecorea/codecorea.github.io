   When heading to Gangneung, I headed to the downtown instead of the first beach I came up with. This is because the destination of Wolhwa Street, which became Gangneung 'Hot Place' these days. Wolhwa Street is a cultural and park facility built on the site of an abandoned railroad that passed through downtown Gangneung.

   When the KTX Gyeonggang Line opened, the underground railroad between Gangneung and the city center became underground, leaving the old railroad tracks as idle. Gangneung City has turned this space into a park where trains no longer run. In other words, the land used to play is transformed into a land where people play while resting.

   One Saturday in the springtime, the early spring aura was evident. It was a good day to walk around Wolhwa Street. Wolhwa Street is a total of 2.6km from Gangneung Station to Gangnam-dong Buheung Village. It is an easy walking course for all ages. You can start at Gangneung Station, so it's great for ‘tuk-bok’ travelers. In addition, there are public parking lots near Ganghwa Station, such as Gangneung Station Parking Lot and Namdaecheon Dunchi Parking Lot, making it convenient for car travelers.

There is a signboard of Wolhwa Street at the entrance of Malnaumteo Park, the gateway to Wolhwa Street. Wolhwa Street is based on the love story of Hwarang Muwolrang and Mrs. Yeonhwa of Gangneung in Gyeongju, Silla era, and it will look a little different even if you walk by knowing that they named the streets after each other.

   It is a healing forest path after passing the Horse Sharing Park. The point of this course with trees is the calligraphy sculpture. You will encounter warm words on the promenade, such as ‘It ’s hard?’, ‘Todak Todak’, ‘Cheer for you’, ‘Do you eat and eat?’ On both sides of the street, houses filled with traces of time stand shoulder to shoulder. It is a space that comforts people who are tired of everyday life with analog scenery and a word. It is a relatively quiet area, so it is good to enjoy a leisurely stroll.

   As you walk a little further, you will see a container-shaped building. Wolhwa Poongmul Market. There are two buildings in Wolhwa Pungmul Market with roads in between. One is Wolhwa Folk Market in Imdang and the other is Wolhwa Folk Market in Geumhak. It is a place that connects the existing market of Imdang and Geumhak. Small shops are stuck in a neat interior. It ranges from shops selling local food such as potato rice cake, tadpole noodles, buckwheat pancakes, and buckwheat pancakes to shops selling coffee, sandwiches and hot dogs. There are also many shops that sit and eat in a stool, taking advantage of the old market atmosphere.

On the exterior of the Wolhwa Folk Market in Limdang, there is a mural of Muwolrang and Ms. Yeonhwa, the symbols of Wolhwa Street, and on the side of Geumhak Wolhwa Folk Market, there is a mural of Gangneung-gwanno Masked Drama during the Gangneung Danoje, a UNESCO humane intangible cultural heritage.

   You may stop at Gangneung Jungang and Seongnam markets for a while before going to Wolhwagyo. From Wolhwa Street, it leads directly to the market. Gangneung Jungang and Seongnam Markets are famous for dried fish, seafood, and Sommori soup, and there are also many Jeonjuburi that travelers line up to eat. Among them, chicken gangjeong, ice cream hotteok, and fish cake croquette. It is more satisfying because the fun of walking in Wolhwa Street adds to the happiness of the market.

   After eating the market, switch back to walking mode! Head to Wolhwa Bridge across Namdaecheon. The road leading to Wolhwa Bridge is a steep uphill course. It was created with a zigzag gentle ramp. As you climb the ramp, you can see Wolhwa Street, which I just walked on one side, and Namdaecheon and Wolhwa Bridge on the other side. Wolhwa Bridge is a remodeling of the railway bridge that the train passed through as a pedestrian bridge.

The Internet of Things (IoT) technology was introduced at Wolhwa Street in order to promote the excellence of Korea's information and communication technology (ICT) to the world by celebrating the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. Walking on Wolhwa Street, you can experience media walls, smart street lights, and virtual reality (VR) panoramas. The smart healing chair “Oh Chair” is one of them.
