   Hanok entered the island. The tree that guarded the island wrapped up the old house after it was declared. Man reached out and made his way and made a pond. The sea from the island was harmonious and named it Sanghwawon. It is the story of a garden on Jukdo. Because of the beautiful scenery, rumors spread across the island. If you're eager to avoid the heat and quiet alone, head to Boryeong-si Jukhwa Garden.

   It takes about 10 minutes to Jukdo after getting off at Daecheon Station on Janghang Line. The island, originally floating on the West Sea, was connected with land by roads for reclamation. Although once in danger of development, the island owner's insistence on maintaining the nature of Jukdo could be preserved.
   <br/>
   The owner pondered a meaningful way to protect the island. It was decided to create a garden named Sanghwawon with the meaning of worshiping harmony. Jukdo was determined not to hurt the nature. What did you think about bringing hanok to the island? The encounter between the two, which felt only heterogeneous, was exquisite when I think about it today. Visitors were happy to meet an unexpected Hanok on the island. It was a hanok that prolonged life in front of the crisis.

   It takes about an hour and a half to roam the whole house. Need to hurry up to the island? Let's set aside the haste. As you enter the Sanghwawon, you will see a handsome Hanok in front of you. It is Uigo Hall. It is a hanok that was built to be used as sperm in Hwaseong Gwana, Gyeonggi-do. It is assumed that it was built during the late Goryeo or early Joseon Dynasty. Before moving to the upper house, he pitched his tent and wrote it as a coffee shop. If you didn't come here for preservation, the house would have been demolished.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Uigok Hall is currently used as a visitor center. Provide a simple drink and rice cake to the audience. Note that there are no restaurants or stalls inside the Sanghwawon. If you do not have enough water to drink, you can use the bottled water stand on the corridor.
   <br/>
   The Sanghwawon viewing starts from the right side with the back of the entrance. Walk along the corridor over 1 km. Give your eyes a green leafy hack before heading to the cloister. There is a humorous wooden boarder who writes about 200 years old, who writes down. A generous shade of trees is a thankful season.

   The corridor followed the path of Jukdo Aboriginal people for a long time. There is no bird boring at the height of the island that resembles the contours of the island. The roof is not difficult to walk in bad weather. There are many stairs, so it is inconvenient to go with a stroller or a wheelchair. There is plenty of shelter with chairs and tables in the middle of the street.

   The beach pond along the corridor is also worth seeing. Cute aquatic plants and fish live. The stone wall around the pond was built directly by human hands.

   The beach reading room comes out when you arrive at about 500m. Is there such a scenery that I can fall for reading slowly? Even if you haven't brought a book, don't miss it. Watching the sea unfold before your eyes, time goes by well. It's a great place to listen to music you've stored on your phone. Buy a bottle of water at a bottled water stand and let your neck cool down for a while. On the far sea, yachts from Boryeong Yacht Stadium float in the wind. Ships sailing often hear pleasant cheers.

   The last course of the Sanghwawon walk is Hanok Village. There are seven hanoks in the village. The house, which was soon to collapse, moved to the Sanghwawon to find a haven. Hanok Village was built on terraced fields, which were the homes of Aboriginal people. One or two houses are seated on a staircase. Thanks to this, you can enjoy the sea view that spreads out in all hanoks. Climbing behind the Gochang-eup government office at the top of the village, you can see the soft lines of the hanok roof and the sea.

   On every pillar of the house there is a signboard detailing the use, history and structure of the house. If you are interested in hanok, it is fun to read. You can also see photos taken before moving to the Sangwon Garden. It's an old house that won't be weird right away. It is easy to imagine that the restoration was as expensive as it is now. Problems that could not be solved by money were replaced by devotion. If the damage is severe, some houses have been restored separately from the main house and the door. Detachable glass walls were installed to protect the house. The small island of the West Sea was the process of becoming the home of Hanok.
   <br/>
   Lee Dae-cheong's house is an a-shaped hanok that looks up to the left after climbing a corridor. The floor has a water purifier and tea bag tea. Enjoy the luxury of a cup of tea while admiring the spectacular view of the West Sea from the wide window. The best cafes are not envious moments. On the other side is Dongheon in Naganan-eup. It was the place where Lee Se-dol 9dan and Park Jung-hwan 9dan played the finals at the 2014 Go tournament. In order to commemorate the competition at that time, a board and a goggle were placed. Everyone may sit for a while and play Go.

   The most prominent hanok in the village is the Gochang-eup Office. It is located at the top of Hanok Village. A pine tree, bowed like a bow, stands through the edge of the cornice. While sitting on the terraced terrain, Hanok was preserved without cutting the original pine tree. Thanks to this, trees connect to life and travelers capture memories of strange landscapes.

   Going up behind the Gochang-eup Office is a pine forest. Imagine if the fog of the island will come from beyond the forest on a foggy day. Heading towards the villa, it is the sky garden. The roof of the villa was built. The roof deck is full of flower pots. The Sangwon Garden is a good place to stay for a few hours. It's easy to take a stroll around the island, and there's plenty to see and do. If you are unhappy with your day trip, you can stay at the villa. Open daily except July-August. During the rest of the year, you can only watch on Fridays, Sundays and public holidays. It is closed from December to March.
