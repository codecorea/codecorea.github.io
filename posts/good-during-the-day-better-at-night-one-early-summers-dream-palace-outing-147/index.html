   You may have heard the word Heungcheong Mangcheong. This word came from Yeonsan-gun, and [Heungcheong] refers to parasites who were drafted into the palace for entertainment in Yeonsan-gun. At the time of Yeonsan-gun, there was a government office called “Chae Hongsa,” which selects a woman with a beautiful appearance at eight degrees across the country. At that time, it was Gyeonghoeru that was the place that made a sound with Hungcheong.

   Changgyeonggung begins with the establishment of Suganggung for King Taejong in the 1418 Goryeo dynasty's Nangung Palace. Since then, Seongjong expanded and supplemented Suganggung to prepare for the preparation of three people, and named it Changgyeonggung during the construction. It wasn't used in the early stages, but after the Imjin War, Changdeokgung Palace played a role as a palace, increasing its utilization as a palace.

   Changgyeonggung, which seemed to have survived, becomes asylum during the Japanese occupation. With the intention of annihilating the dignity of the palace and the Joseon Dynasty, Japanese imperialism demolished most of the buildings in Changgyeonggung and established a zoo and a botanical garden. In 1911, even his name was downgraded to Changgyeongwon. Since liberation, it has been trying to revive the original appearance of the palace.

   Deoksugung Palace, which buried the history of the old Korean words
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Deoksugung, the royal palace of the Korean Empire, was originally the home of Seongjong's older brother Wolsandaegun. Later, the ancestors used it as a palace during the Imjin War, and in 1611, Gwanghae-gun gave it a formal palace called 'Gyeongwoong Palace', which was called Jeongneung-dong Haenggung.

   It was with the establishment of the Korean Empire in 1897 that Gyeongung Palace appeared on the front of history. At its peak, it boasted three times the size of today. Then, as Emperor Gojong retreated, Gyeongwoong Palace changed its status as the residence of the Emperor Seon, and the name changed to Deoksugung. Subsequently, a part of the Gaknaeksa Temple and the Hwangudan were demolished, and their status disappeared.

   After the death of Gojong, the brutality of Japanese imperialism becomes more persistent. The area of Saigon and Proof of War were sold out, and the palace itself was reduced. Afterwards, it was created as a park and released to the public. In the area around Deoksugung Palace, the modern and modern turbulent period of this land permeates every corner.
