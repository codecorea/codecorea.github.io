   There are quite a few stories about “my name book” in which the king's concubines and court ladies belong to. In contrast, there aren't many stories about endopsies. 'Naesibu', the dictionary, is introduced as 'a government office in charge of meals in the royal court of the Joseon Dynasty and the delivery of the royal name.' All staff were appointed by officials, and the chief crest of the inner city was the second merchant vessel, which served as the king's meal and attendant secretary. The second piece is the fourth product line in the Joseon Dynasty. It shows a different power from the image that was evoked. Of course, it may be a bit lower than the “Women's women” who were able to go up to the first item, but the “men of the kings” who stayed close to the king's closest side also enjoyed a lot of power.

They were castrated and could not play a male role. Nevertheless, those who came to power as "men of the king" marryed and adopted their families. Various unpleasant events led to the appeal of subordinates against the marriage of the eunuchs, but thanks to the royal court, the eunuchs also enjoyed a "marriage life."

In Choansan where Joseon Dynasty was located, you can see Moon Seok Seok dressed in bokdu and brass robes. First abdominal hunger. Bokdu is the coffin used by the former Joseon Dynasty's past disciples when they received a red card. The brass vest means the robe of the Munmu White, which was worn in the ordinances and the auspicious things of a hat decorated with gold. Comparing the two quickly reveals the difference. It is enough to prepare for a visit to Choansan Tomb Myeon if you look for the “stone” made of wide stones and the “stone monument” made to praise the deceased and pass it on to future generations.
