   Bear Tree Park with trees and bears
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Bear Tree Park is a place where you can see various trees, cute bears, and various birds. The pond with silk carp welcomes travelers, and the path around juniper trees like a folding screen is exotic. The stone silicite is mysterious at any time. There is a ‘God ’s Tree’ around Gyuhwaseok, but it looks bizarre at first sight. According to the information board, it is made of cypress roots grown on the cliffs of Alishan in central Taiwan. Based on the size of the roots, it is estimated that it is about 2,000 years old.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Various bonsai in the bonsai garden also attracts the attention of travelers. You can see various bonsai trees such as pine trees, yew trees, and maple trees. It feels more like a miniature tree. There is also the pleasure of seeing closely, but if you look at it from a distance, it comes with a different feeling. On one side of the bonsai garden, water lilies show off an alluring appearance.

    On the way to Biamsa, the first thing that greets travelers is Dokkaebi Road. Near the entrance to Biamsa Temple, there is a sign board that informs you of the “start point of Dokkaebi Road”. If you put your car gear in neutral and stand still, the car will go up a path that looks like an uphill path. This is because of the optical illusion.

   Biamsa has a history dating back 2,000 years. Although not recorded, it is said that it is a temple of the Samhan period. There is a theory that the founding of Dosunguksa was founded at the end of the Unified Silla period, but the most prominent is the assertion that it is a temple in the Goryeo period. It is estimated that the three-story stone pagoda in the temple courtyard was in the Goryeo Dynasty. In the Joseon Dynasty records, the name Biamsa appears.

    On the top of the three-story stone pagoda in Biamsa, a monument to the Amita Buddha, the National Treasure No. 106, was found. The three-story stone tower itself was designated as tangible cultural property No. 3. The Yeongsanhoe gwabultanghwa, which was produced in 1657, was designated as tangible cultural property No. 12. Gwabulbultanhwa refers to a large discord that hangs in the front yard of a temple to perform a law or ritual at a temple, and Biamsa Gwabultanghwa is characterized by the precise time of creation, garden, and Bongan. The Sozo Amitabha statue, which was produced in the first half of the 17th century, is now regarded as a main Buddha for the preservation of paradise. Overall height is 196 cm. It is made of clay, not wooden, and is designated as tangible cultural property No. 13.

    We stopped at Gobok Reservoir for lunch before heading to Yeongpyeongsa Temple, our last destination. In the vicinity of Gobok Reservoir, there are several restaurants that boil and sell catfish spicy and freshwater prawn spicy. I picked one of them and went in. I stopped by 10 years ago and had a freshwater shrimp soup, but now I built a new building a little far from my old seat. After meals, you can take a walk around Gobok Reservoir. When spring comes, it will taste good for a walk.
