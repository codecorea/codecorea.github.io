   Gimhae, Gyeongsangnam-do, was the place where King Kim Suro was born and the land where Gaya's history began. On top of that, the Gimhae Gaya Theme Park and the National Gimhae Children's Museum were created to create a space where children can understand and experience history. At the Gimhae Mokjae Cultural Experience Center, you can feel the warmth of the wood, and at the Clayarch Gimhae Museum, you can feel the authenticity of a potter who bakes ceramics. Could it be that the broad plains and the stems of the Nakdong River, which flows through, wrap around the city? The child's face soon resembles nature.

   In October, when the clear autumn breeze stimulates the outing, the first destination is the Nakdong River Rail Park, one of the essential courses for the Gimhae trip. The course of the railroad crossing of the Nakdong River crosses the Gyeongjeon Line and Gyeongjeon Line's closed train tracks that have crossed Gyeongsang-do and Jeolla-do for over 100 years. Gimhae Nakdong River Rail Park is famous as the only railroad theme park in Korea where a wine cave and a train cafe are combined with a rail bike.
