   It contains real snow crab, soraepogu snow crab bread

  <div class="txt_p">
   Sorae Port, where the memories of the Suin Line narrow gauge train remain. Nowadays, it is more famous as a fish market that is full of aquatic products such as blue crab, shrimp, and salted fish. Sorae Pogu Traditional Fish Market is always full of vitality thanks to the strong voices of the merchants selling fresh seasonal seafood and goods. You can also sit on one side of the marina and eat it after you eat it in the market. Near the fish market is Sorae History Museum, which shows the history of Sorae.

  <div class="txt_p">
   If you've toured the Sorae Pogu Fish Market and Sorae History Museum, it's time to taste the Sorae Pogu specialty bread. On the 1st floor of the Sorae Pogu Fish Market building next to the Sorae History Museum, where there is a narrow gauge train, there is a shop called 'Uljin Daege Bread'. Uljin Snow Crab is located in Sorae Pogu, so it's easy to think of it as a chain store, but surprisingly, this is the main store. The owner of Uljin's hometown, the first crab crab in Uljin, is now headquartered in Soraepogu. The store in Hupo Port, Uljin is a direct store. Sorae Pogu without going to Uljin far, it is also good because you can taste snow crab bread at the main store.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Incheon Chinatown with reddish colors. The signboard in Chinese characters and the Chinese heard here and there are similar, and it makes you feel like you are in China. After the opening of Incheon Port in 1883, the following year, Cheongguk Jogyoji was established. It is the beginning of Incheon China Town. Chinatown was built as Chinese people built Chinese-style houses and dominated the commercial area. In the past, retail stores that handle a variety of Chinese products mainly dominated, but now most Chinese restaurants. As the place where Jajangmyeon was born for the first time in Korea, it is crowded with tourists who want to taste Jajangmyeon and various Chinese food on weekends. When you enter the main street of Chinatown, you often see people lined up in long lines.

   A short walk from Chinatown brings you to Songwol-dong Fairy Tale Village. Unlike Chinatown, which was a reddish heaven and earth, the colorful scenery unfolds. Unlike many mural villages across the country, the feature is that it is decorated with the theme of “fairy tale”. Fairy-tale heroes, such as Snow White, Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, and Wizards of Oz, are accustomed to everyone in the village. The fairy-tale scenery that fills the residential area arouses conscience not only for children but also for adults.
