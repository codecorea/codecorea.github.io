    From the Daehak-ro, the street of culture, the path to Seongbuk-dong, where Han Yong-woon's deep actors and novelist Sang-tae Lee and Tae-jun Lee's Suyeonsanbang go beyond Naksan, is an alley to memories with poetry, novels and murals.

    Exit Hyehwa Station Exit 2 and look back to see the Samsa building covered in ivy leaves. The starting point of this walking tour is the building, but before we start, we look back at the fertilization on the street.
    <br/>
    The poet Kim Gwang-gyun's poetry, who wrote the poem &lt;Snowy Night,&gt; begins with "Where's the good news / because it's noisy?" In front of the tombstone engraved with &lt;Seolha&gt;, we examine the poet's delicate feelings of a season.

   Come back to Samsa Temple, back on the main road, go straight to the road next to Samsa Temple, turn right at Samgeori, go a little, turn left, and then turn right at the next crossroad to follow the road. This is the way from Daehak-ro to Naksan Park. You can follow the milestones of Naksan Park or Seoul Castle.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   As you go uphill, you will see the first mural. Wall paintings are called murals, but murals are like folk paintings that have been passed down since ancient times. The Korean National Encyclopedia defines “People painting as a popular commercialization made according to the traditional customs of a nation or individual,” so it is natural that a camel pictured on the wall of the village was named because it resembled a camel. It will be work.

   It was not difficult to think of childhood at the wall of an old house. Sunny alleys have always been the playgrounds of children in the neighborhood. When I heard the voices of the mothers calling the children, “Eat, eat” in the alley where the tide descended and ran until the darkness settled down, there was an evening returning home, trying hard to play more. When the lights on the dark alley windows turned on one by one, the moon floated on the back of the mountain, and it lit up the son-in-law.

   A small sculpture walking in the air came to my eyes while thinking of the old days. This is a scene of a man and a dog in suits stepping towards Naksan Forest and buildings in downtown Seoul. People passing by take pictures there. It seems that the forest, the city, and the village became the background of the cartoon film with one of the sculptures. It seems to have taken off the middle film of a story and brought it there. The beginning and end of the story will be different for each person looking at the sculpture.

   Leave the sculpture behind, follow the road, turn left and pass in front of Dongsung Daycare Center. Then, at the forked road, turn right. On the way, go up the stairs to the right, turn right, and go a little further to Naksanjeong. Before going to the sperm, 'Hongdeok Ibat' comes out.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Hongdeok Ibat is the place where the story of Bongrimdae and Hongdeok, who were taken hostage in the Qing Dynasty after the Byeongjahoran, remain. Hong Deok-yi put kimchi in a bowl at Bolmoji for the Bongrim troops who were captured. The Bongrim Daegun, who could not forget the taste, gave a field to eat the kimchi that Hong Deok-i soaked when he returned to Korea. After that, Hong Deok-yi grew cabbage in a field, and told Kim Bong-rim that became King Hyo-jong, soaked kimchi.
   <br/>
   After passing the field of Hongdeok, take a sigh at Naksanjeong and go again. When the road with the castle comes out, turn left and go to Naksan Park. You can see the sign “Naksan Park” outside the castle wall. Move your steps to the lower village of Naksan Park.

   The lower village of Naksan Park is Samseon-dong, just below Seoul Castle. This is the moon village where houses are built on a rock and houses of pottery are gathered in a narrow alley. In the alleys of Daldongne, like a spider web, two people who come across each other can barely pass by, but the scent of a rich life is evident in alleys.

Hyehwamun is one of the eight gates that were built during the construction of the Seoul Castle in the early Joseon Dynasty. The door is open daily from 9 am to 6 pm. Enter the door, climb the stairs and follow the alley-like path. Then, go down the stairs and go out the door, and the castle continues across the street. Now walk the alleyways with the castle on the left. Along the way, if you continue to pass the Gyeongsin Middle and High School, you will see a wide driveway. Cross the crossing, turn right, and then go down a little and you will see the way to Seoul Castle.

   When you leave the deep right turn and turn left and go down the alley, you will see “Manhae's Walking Park” with the statue of Manhae. From there, turn right and follow the road to the Seongbuk Museum of Art across the street and the Hanok House next to it. The hanok is the home of the novelist Sang-he Lee Tae-jun. Now they are selling tea and drinks under the name 'Suyeonsanbang'.

   Sangheo Lee Tae-jun is a North Korean writer, and he and his work have not been introduced in Korea until the work was lifted in 1988. There are many short stories and feature stories such as &lt;Moon Night&gt;, &lt;Oh Mong-Nyeo&gt;, &lt;Raining Rainy&gt;, &lt;Bokdeokbang&gt;, &lt;Youngwol Inspiration&gt;, &lt;Bamgil&gt;. The house in Pocheon (Cheorwon) where he lived was moved to the present location, but the Sangsimru was burned down during the Korean War. The building in front of the booth is the seat of Sangsimru.

   The day of walking from Hakhak-ro to Seongbuk-dong, feeling the scent of art left on the alleys of memories, ends in Suyeonsanbang. There seems to be no good place like this to finish the day trip while enjoying the charm of Hanok.
