    The National Daegu Science Museum, where you can see 233 interesting exhibits, including the world's largest water clock, a center of gravity public bicycle, SOS to know all the earth's environments, and Korea's largest experiential exhibition life coaster. All of those exhibits are all interesting and novel, but there are ten amazing things you shouldn't miss. Let's meet the pride of the National Daegu Science Museum.

    When you enter the Science Museum, the first thing that stands out is. It is a water clock 11m high. The sculpture, the world's largest water clock, is the work of French physicist and plastic artist Dr. Bernard Jitton. A large glass pipe moves 320 liters of liquid on the principle of free fall and siphon, and water fills the sphere representing the hours and minutes to tell the time. The water that flows unceasingly embodies the science that never stops and develops without staying.

   The core exhibit in Hall 1 is the SOS (Science On a Sphere) system. This large 2m diameter ball floating in the air is a system for observing global environmental changes. What is El Nino and what is La Nina? Where did the many east coast squid go? Will more snow fall in winter if global warming continues? How can we save the planet from warming? These questions are solved by standing in front of this big ball. If you are watching vivid images of typhoons' travel paths, world volcanic activity, and the Earth's night and day, you fall into the illusion of observing the Earth from space.

    The most popular exhibition in Hall 1 is the public unicycle. The curiosity as to why I would fall after the circulating air rail with a unicycle is springing up. The answer is center of gravity! You can experience the meaning of the center of gravity through a large additional air bike. There is also a corner explaining the secrets of how an airplane can fly without losing its center.

   ‘What did you feel?’ Is a place where students' curiosity is most triggered. Nothing can be seen through the black double curtain. The sound of water may be heard, the cool air may rub, and the smell of baking may be heard when you carefully watch with your hands. In addition to what we see, we realize how important sensory organs such as hearing, smell and touch are.
