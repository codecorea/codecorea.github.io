   No electricity, no water. Primitive outfits also shoot arrows. The tribes also compete for food. Canned shellfish and fish caught in nets are the food that day. Firewood should be lit with a flint behind the pan, but the fish can be grilled. Shihodo is the place where people live away from civilization.

   One day in Shiho Island begins with the return of cell phones from the Kowloon Village dock on the same side of the island. Shiho-do is named after a tiger dying. When you arrive at the dock and go over the belly material that corresponds to the tiger's belly, the elasticity of ‘와’ comes out. The primitive tents, which can be used by four or five people, create an imagination that seemed to immerse themselves in the popular TV program "Jungle's Law." When your phone rings, you get busy, and you'll be out of date.
