   To pass Mungyeong Saejae, you must go through three gateways. The first door is the main hall. Juhl Mountain rises to the east as shown in the picture, and Joryong Mountain extends to the west. The acidity that comes out for landscape painting and the curvaceousness of the soft walls are well combined. Electric cars run from the parking lot to the first gate, making it easy for seniors to travel.

   The path leading to the opposite side of the mountain leads to the path of the rabbit. It is a small stone road leading to a cliff, which was named Bunny Bira because he found a way out when he saw a rabbit escaped along the cliff when King Taejo Wang Geon was in a dilemma because of a road blockage.

   I'm hungry sooner because I have more movement than usual in my travel destination. If you go to Mungyeong, I recommend some food to try. First of all, it is Yakdol Bulgogi, which can be considered as a specialty of Mungyeong. Make a yakdol bulgogi from pork raised with finely ground medicinal stone called Geojeongsuk and mixed with feed. There is no odor and the texture is chewy.
