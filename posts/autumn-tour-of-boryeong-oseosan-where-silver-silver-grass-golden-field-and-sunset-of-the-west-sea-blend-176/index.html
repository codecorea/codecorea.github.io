   Autumn has come silently, but the ripe autumn leaves still have to wait. As I wait for the autumn leaves, I go to a place where I'm impatient or the autumn breeze is overwhelming. It is a silver grass colony of Oseo Mountain in Boryeong, Chungnam. The sunset over the silver grass, the golden field and the glow of the west coast are bonuses. I loaded my body on a train on the Janghang Line and walked into the autumn.

   At this time when the news of the autumn leaves is heard, the silver grass that gleams with silver also attracts travelers. Oseosan, which spans Boryeong, Hongseong, and Cheongyang, Chungcheongnam-do, has a spectacular view of silver grass since early October. It is considered as one of the top five silver grass spots in the nation, along with Myeongseongsan Mountain in Pocheon-si, Gyeonggi-do, Mindongsan Mountain in Jeongseon-gun in Gangwon, Cheongwansan Mountain in Jangheung-gun, Jeollanam-do, and Sajapyeong Saegil-gil in Ulju-gun, Ulsan. One of the eight sights of Boryeong is the silver grass that stretched gently on the ridge of Oseo Mountain. It has a view of Daecheon Beach, Muchangpo and Oeyeon Islands, so you can see half the unexplored sights of Boryeong at about 8 moments on the ridge.

   Oseosan is a rarely high mountain (790m above sea level) on the west coast where most of the plains are located. It is for this reason that the scenery under the feet is toxic. Standing at the summit, the sea spreads to the west and the fields of Hongseong and Cheongyang to the east.

   Standing on the platform, the gentle ridge of Oseo Mountain can be seen at a glance. As the name of 'blue place', the scenery over the railroad tracks is all over the forest and the sky. It is also a good idea to stop for a moment at the simple station in the autumn sun and feel the relaxed mood. Taxi waiting for hikers is always waiting in front of the cleaning station. It takes 10-15 minutes to reach Seongyeon Parking Lot, the head of Oseosan Mountain or Oseosan Natural Recreation Forest.

   The heads to Oseosan silver grass colony are the counseling parking lot in Damsan-ri, Gwangcheon-eup, Hongseong-gun, the Seongyeon parking lot in Seongyeon-ri, Jangyeon-myeon, Boryeong-si, and the Oseosan natural recreation forest in Janghyeon-ri, Cheongnyeon. The shortest route to the summit of Oseosan is the Oseosan Natural Recreation Forest Course. It is good to stay overnight in a recreational forest and go up and down.

   It is the fastest way to go straight from the management office to Woljeongsa Temple, but the path leading to Woljeongsa Temple from the forest experience route on the left side of the Forest Culture Recreation Center is even more impressive. It takes about 1 hour and 30 minutes from the forest experience route to the top of Oseo Mountain. As it is a short course, the slope is quite steep, so it is better to climb with a spare time.

   The forest experience is a gentle dirt road. The hornbeam tree, the dead tree, the willow tree, and the oak tree form a dense forest to cover the sky. The green color is still widespread, but chestnuts and fallen leaves accumulate to give off the autumn mood. After passing the trail for about 20 minutes, we reach Woljeongsa Temple when the sound of the wooden voice approaches. Gujeolcho bloomed all over the small hermitage.

   I hung my neck at Woljeongsa Temple and went on my way again. The pine forest lined up on both sides boasts a quiet atmosphere. Occasionally, the red-colored maple trees mark the path of autumn. When the pine forest road ends and the three-way intersection comes out, the uphill road begins in earnest. By the time you climb your steep path for 15 minutes, you can see a sign that you have 700m to the summit.

   When you climb the ridge and see the communication tower, the summit of Oseosan is in front of you. From here, the ridge-filled ridgeline extends for about 2 km. The silver grass that grew as tall as both sides of the trail breaks the road like an escort, and the silver grass colony waving constantly in the breeze of the sea creates a spectacular view. The silver grass, which begins to bloom from the beginning of October, peaks in mid-October by blooming whiter and more abundant flowers.

The silver grass, which shimmered in silver during the day, is golden in the evening. It is a scenery that "you can get away from all kinds of wrestling and taste the ecstasy" like the words engraved on the headstone of the summit. However, in the fall, the sun is short, so it is better to go down as quickly as possible.

   The river line flowing from Boryeong dyke to the West Sea can be seen at a glance over the field. On fine days, Daecheon Beach, Muchangpo Beach, and floating islands spread far and wide. The crow often flies in the distant landscape, but the name Oseosan originated from the many crows since ancient times. There is a theory that when you look at Oeyeon Island, a long distance from the land, you can see the mountain black and named it Oseo Mountain.
