    I have a carpenter friend. When asked about the merits of work, the answer is, "I can touch the tree." I also like to touch trees. The texture of the wood is 'emotional' compared to other objects. Not smooth but calm While living in wood, even after dying in furniture and books. So when you touch a tree, 'good' and 'reliable' are pushed to one side of your heart.

   On a clear autumn day, I went to Incheon to touch the trees. There are many wood culture experience places. But why is it Incheon? Mokyeon-ri, a wooden cultural experience center in Incheon Grand Park, is a special place. One huge design.

   Unlike the existing timber culture center, it is a modern exposed concrete building. Special wooden devices also give life to the body. Or is it the World Architecture Community (WAC) World Architecture Award and the Red Dot Design Award Concept? The name of the grand park, the zelkova tunnel, the buckwheat blossoms and the cosmos under the ground can also make you flutter.

   Mokyeon-ri, Incheon Grand Park Wood Culture Experience Center, is a two-story building. On the first floor, there is a ginkgo workshop used by elementary school students and adults. The zelkova workshop on the second floor has a family. Children make their parents, cloud-shaped plates, planes, and so on. Although it is at the level of duke, the imagination of the filmmaker's hand is rough.

   Next to the zelkova workshop on the 2nd floor is the Cloud Playground. It is full of wooden toys such as tool play and train play. The pool full of cypress balls is especially popular. It's a phytoncide playground. The lobby on the second floor is rich in wood, due to the tight planks on the ceiling.

   There is a nail and sawing experience in the lobby on the first floor. If you drop by, it's worth a try. There is an angel wing photo zone on the entrance wall of the building. Wood Experience Center Mokyeon-ri is adjacent to Incheon Arboretum. It is a good size for a light walk with children. If you want to visit the grand park together, the southern wetlands, pampas grass, and infant forest experience center are suitable for autumn ecological learning.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Ginkgo workshop on the first floor is perfect when you're with a lover or a friend. Make living supplies such as wooden speakers, mini-shops, and reading stands. It is a form of assembling wooden boards prepared in advance, but the process of touching and pasting wood is more interesting than you think. Sometimes they come in loved ones or friends and make each other's gifts.
   <br/>
   To relax and enjoy Mokyeon-ri's architecture, head to the outdoor deck shelter next to the 2nd Floor Cloud Playground. Corresponds to the inside of the triangle's acute angle. In the circumference, a wooden board shaped like '∧' is stacked to form a screen. In the meantime, relax and enjoy the view of Incheon Grand Park or Arboretum. Floor patterns vary when shadows are cast. Carpentry experiences are scheduled for both workshops twice a week and three weekends. The experience fee (excluding material cost) is inexpensive at 2000-3000 won.

   Lovers are encouraged to rent bicycles for couples at the bike square. If you rent a bicycle, you will go to the alumni garden of the Alumni side. In late September, buckwheat flowers are in full bloom. There are several beans in the middle of the buckwheat field. Why don't you read a book and make a fairy tale in autumn? Cosmos that sometimes fly adds to the mood of autumn.

   For photography, we recommend a trail that enters from the park stand. Brown 'ambience walls' stand out among the pine branches. The interior contrasts the pattern of two-storey oak planks and ambience walls. At sunset, the shadows of the ambience wall change to create an interesting pattern. The concrete part of the building is colorful, expressing the texture of the tree.

     Traffic tips:
    </b>
    When using the subway in Seoul, it is faster to transfer the bus at Songnae Station than Incheon Grand Park Station. From July, the limited express (Yongsan Station-Dongincheon Station) subway will operate nine one-way trips (between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm). It takes 26 minutes from Yongsan Station to Songnae Station.
