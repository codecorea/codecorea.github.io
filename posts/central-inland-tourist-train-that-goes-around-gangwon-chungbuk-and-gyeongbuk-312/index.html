   The Nuriro train, which runs at 150km / h, has been reborn as a tourist train. The central inland tourist train includes the central inland circulation train and the Baekdudaegan Gorge Train. The central inland circulation train (O-train) connects Seoul ~ Cheonan ~ Chungju ~ Jecheon ~ Danyang ~ Punggi ~ Yeongju ~ Bonghwa ~ Chunyang ~ Buncheon ~ Yangwon ~ Cheolam. Among them, the Buncheon-Cheolam section belongs to the Baekdu-daegan Gorge Train (V-Train). The Taebaek Line section, such as Jeongseon ~ Yeongwol ~ Gohan ~ Cheonjeon ~ Taebaek, which was stopped at the beginning of the train operation, is not currently operating.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Tourist trains have very different feelings inside and outside. The exterior has a bright color scheme, and the interior has a comfortable atmosphere made of wood. The door between the square and the square, which is beautifully patterned with stained glass, is also nice. In the luggage compartment above the seats, there are poems containing the four seasons of Korea and folklore. In addition, there are a variety of convenience facilities such as a children's playroom, cafe, shop, and observation deck.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Through the window, the landscape and the world unfold like a panorama. Viewing nature through the window is so beautiful that it would be appropriate for ‘watching’ rather than ‘viewing’, and the atmosphere in the room adds emotion to the journey. However, if you eat a lot of good food, you will get tired. In this case, it is a priority to maintain comfort until you get off while taking various postures such as rest, relaxation, and appreciation. If you have your favorite music, books you want to read, or even more movies, take them on a portable device. There is an outlet near the seat, so it is convenient to prepare a charging cable.

   The story of the railroad until it transformed into a comfortable and comfortable tourist train is also interesting. The Taebaek Line, Jungang Line, and Yeongdong Line, which were created near Baekdu-daegan, were called the main arteries of modernization and industrialization of the Republic of Korea. In the 1990s, cargo, minerals and passenger transport through railroads fell into a recession, but through that time, clean nature in the central inland region emerged as a tourism resource. This is the reason for the emergence of a train dedicated to the central inland region that connects the central inland area with the city residents.

   Naturally, the first of the eight Danyang sights, “Dodam Sambong,” attracts attention. Dodam Sambong originally said that Sambongsan Mountain in Jeongseon, Gangwon-do was brought down during the flood and became the current Dodam Sambong. Another interesting story is told here.

    At that time, they unfairly demanded taxes on Sambong that flowed from Jeongseon to Danyang. A boy said, “We are not asking you to leave Sambong, but rather we are blocking the water and seeing damage. "There is no reason to pay taxes on the useless peaks, so take them back." This is the ‘Dangchan’ boy, Jeong-jeon Jeon, the nation ’s national official.

It travels slowly at 30 km / h, and it feels like a train is walking. Thanks to you, you can enjoy the flesh of Baekdu-daegan in a relaxed way.

   Sometimes, traveling on a fast, sometimes slow train has a rhythm similar to that of walking. It's like turning your way to the place you want to go, and slowing down for a while if you have a good view. At the beginning of Korea's railroad history, the sadness of the Japanese imperialism was in a hurry, but now it has become a thankful existence that leads to a happy journey.
