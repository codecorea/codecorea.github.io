   The laughter of people who covered their bodies with mud never stops. This is the story of the Mud Festival held in the Boryeong Daecheon Beach. There are many things to enjoy besides mud massage. From sky bikes, sea baths to soothe the heat of the day, to mud baths and bubble baths. I don't think there is such a place to enjoy the hot summer. Above all, all of these are open to anyone. It is a record of travel with members of the Chungnam Severity Independent Living Association.

    The impression is doubled in the kids zone, a little away from the main venue. Although the name is Kids Zone, it is an open experience area that can be used by the elderly and the disabled. The kids zone, which has been prepared for safety since this year, can be reached in a minute by tram car from the second watchtower. There are a variety of things to do, such as bubble experience, mud experience, and water slide. Even though there are no BF facilities such as ramps or braille blocks, the reason why you can enjoy this place is because of the help of the staff.

   From mud and foam bottoms, from helping to prevent slippers from slipping through, jumping over huge thigh-high tubes and climbing downhill water slides, they all help. It's not just helping, but helping with all your heart. Soap bubbles and mud wash the eyes of those who have entered the eyes, hand over water to quench their thirst, and drag an experienced person who wants to slide in front, slide from the back, and climb an inclined tube. With the help, the face of the experienced person who enjoys the obstacles of the body freely is as bright as a child. I think I may have seen such an excited face recently. Every moment, the faces of the staff who help you are full of joy. It is full of sincerity and sincerity as if caring for each family.

   The bike with the guardian begins to move forward little by little. From the crowded beaches to the horizon far away from the crowded people, you can see the beautiful scenery of the ocean in front of Daecheon at a glance. Although it is sunny, the wind blows at the speed of running. If it's still hot, you can unfold the rainbow-colored umbrellas, each plugged into the back of the front seat. It would be fun if it were flat. There are 203 meters and 173 meters downhill, respectively, on the way to the loop point and on the way back from the loop point to the platform. The maximum speed of the downhill section is 20 km / h. Because of the high tide time, the thrill of enjoying on the sea filled with water is dizzy. Of course, if there is a downhill, there is also an uphill. Fortunately, the uphill course is equipped with an automatic driving system on the rail, so you don't have to pedal hard.
