   The Quan Yin Bodhisattva appeared during the unification Silla crisis
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Before the founding of Naksansa Temple, I stopped worrying about studying in the Tang Dynasty and returned to Silla. He was anticipating the invasion of the Tang Dynasty, and there were signs of rebellion of the nobleman who had disliked against the unification of the Three Kingdoms. Above all, when internal unity was important, costume ambassadors heard rumors that the Gwaneum Bodhisattva was in Yangyang, Gangwon-do. Gwaneum Bodhisattva is a bodhisattva that relieves the sufferings of the rebirth, so the costume ambassador went directly to Yangyang. After praying for 21 days in the Gwaneumgul Cave under Hongryeonam, he was finally able to meet the Gwaneum Bodhisattva. The Gwaneum Bodhisattva said that bamboo would sprout in pairs, so it would be advisable to build a fire there. Where bamboo emerged, costume ambassadors established a cylindrical preservation. That's why Naksansa Temple is considered to be the best place to preserve it.
   </p>

  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Experts from the Cultural Heritage Administration and the National Institute for Cultural Heritage participated in the restoration of Naksansa Temple. Pine trees grown in Yangyang were used to restore cylindrical integrity. In the early Joseon Dynasty, Wonpyeongbojeon, a three-front style on the Palgak roof, has a sense of stability and magnificent energy like a central court hall with three columns on the front and three sides on the side. The closer to the maintenance of the cylinder, the more vivid the color and the more delicate the monochromatic, the more I don't know where to put my eyes. Just look at the rafters to see how much you've been devoted to.

   Cultural assets such as the Geonchil Kannon Bodhisattva Statue (Treasure No. 1362), the Seven-story Stone Pagoda (Treasure No. 499), and the fence (Gangwon-do Tangible Cultural Heritage No. 34) are gathered near Wontongbojeon. The statue of the Geonchil Guan Yin Bodhisattva is inside the cylindrical preservation. The Buddha statue, which has a traditional style in the late Goryeo Dynasty, was created in the early Joseon Dynasty and is an important cultural property that still remains intact. A delicate expression such as a gentle expression, a slender finger, and delicate wrinkles on the clothes stand out.

   There is a seven-story stone pagoda in front of the cylindrical preservation. The tower was raised from the 3rd floor to the 7th floor in the 13th year of King Sejo (1467). It is partially damaged, but remains intact until the metal fittings at the top of the tower, and you can see a crude double lotus pattern at the base.

   It is said that the fence of Wontongbojeon was built when Joseon Dynasty recited Naksansa. Tiles and soil were stacked one after another, and granite with a circular cross section was placed everywhere. It is regarded as a representative fence of the Joseon Dynasty temple.

   Harmony between Naksansa Temple and nature, Seawater Gwaneumsang, Medical College, Hongnyeonam

   Heading to the Seawater Gwaneumsang from Wontongbojeon, another attraction of Naksansa Temple awaits. It is the section from Haesu Gwaneumsang to Gaeseongdae to Hongnyeonam. It is about 20 minutes on foot, but just turn your head to stop the harmony between Naksansa Temple and nature.

   The Seawater Kannon Statue is a giant Buddha statue 15m in height and 3m in circumference. The construction period is quite as large as it was, but it began to be polished in 1971 and completed in 6 years and 6 months. When you look back at the sea and look at the Buddha statue, it looks like the Gwaneum Bodhisattva stands on the Baekdu-daegan. Following that line of sight, head to the next destination, the Costume University and Hongnyeonam.

   The wardrobe and the area of Hongnyeonam were separately designated as Myeongseung No. 27. This is because the surrounding coast is unique and the scenery is beautiful, but it is the place where the legend of the costume ambassador is enshrined. Hongnyeonam is derived from the name of the costume ambassador because he saw Gwaneum Bodhisattva in the red lotus.

   The inside of Hong Ye-moon and Naksanbae Sijomok are also worth noting. The appearance of the pear tree is so peculiar that it stands out. According to the records, as a true product of the Joseon Dynasty, the imperial family was grown around Naksansa. As a result, in 1915, the monk Gwangsimrang, one of the pear varieties, began to cultivate in Tokyo, and has continued the reputation of Naksanbae. Already the water has risen on the pear tree branch that is the eponymous, and the pale green is wrapped.

   The phrase “Ask the way on the road” is engraved on the stairs near the costume hall. Didn't you say that it was a forked road with a choice? When charging is needed, and when the mind and body are exhausted, the temple stay at Naksansa Temple is a good comma. The program is divided into a rest type and an experiential type, and foreigners can also apply. Naksansa Temple provides free noodles to visitors (excluding Mondays). Opening hours are from 11:30 am to 1 pm. Please refer to the Naksansa Temple as it can solve the dispatch box. On the way, if you want to meet Gangwon-do, where you will emanate spring energy, National Route 44 from Hongcheon to Osakryeong and Yangyang is the perfect place.
