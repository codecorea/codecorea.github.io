   The cold wind blows winter. I don't want to slump in the hot bottom quilt, but the child is different. Children who want to play so that the ball becomes red, hold the parents' sleeves to the front door. At this time, let's plan a winter family trip to Yeongdong, Chungbuk without worry. Located at the foot of the Chubaeknyeong Mountain in the Sobaek Mountain Range, Yeongdong is famous for its high fruit sugar content as a regional feature with large daily intersections. In summer, peaches and grapes, and in autumn, apples, persimmons, and pears, if you add 'Yeongdong' to the name of the fruit, it is a fruit country. So it's easy to think that there are no things to see or eat in a frozen winter, but you are welcome. Winter in Yeongdong is full of experiences for children. At Chupungryeong Deer Tourist Farm, you can meet lovely flower deer in front of you and spend 2 days and 1 night in a variety of experiences. Enjoy the wine bath experience in Wine Korea, representing the hometown of grapes and wine, and the rare experience of ringing the world's largest drum in Yeongdong Gugak Experience Village. Let's build happy memories this winter in Yeongdong, Chungbuk.

In the summer, Yeongdong is excited by the purple grape festival, but there are many wines that can enjoy the sweet grape flavor even in winter. Currently, there are over 50 winery farmhouses in Yeongdong. Let's go to Wine Korea. The cold winter wine foot bath experience melts the fatigue accumulated during the trip.
