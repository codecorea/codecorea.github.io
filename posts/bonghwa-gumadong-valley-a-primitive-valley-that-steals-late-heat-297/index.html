    The water flowing from the foot of Taebaek Mountain made the Guma-dong Valley. The valley extends for over 10 km between dense forests, and above it is a valley of birds and mountain beasts that cannot be carried by humans. When you walk with a stream of water next to you, you feel like jumping in quickly.

  <div class="txt_p">
   The valley is not unusual from the head. The path that a car can barely pass through, and the cross section of a carved mountain foot is as weird as the monster land in the movie The Lord of the Rings. The left side of the road is a cliff that goes directly to the valley. Water flows from the cut section of the mountain.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   It is 7 to 8 km from Kuma Red Lodging Bed and Breakfast. So far, there is no way to go down the valley. From the end of the mountain, people smell. The houses that entered the valley did not form a village and sat down one or two sparsely. A house was laid in the middle of a sloped field.

   Aside from the cliffs that fall into the valley, they are all mountains and cliffs. The word ‘Chapguksan’ fits perfectly into this valley. As you go upstream, you become accustomed to the breath of the valley, from the eyes, ears, nose and pores. One cover seat I met on the road tells me that there was an elementary school here. The “Goseon National School”, which opened in 1962 in the valley, was closed on March 1, 1992. Over 30 years, 140 graduated from the school.

   The mountains are high and the valleys are deep, so darkness comes early. The place where the tree covered the sky is dim. The fresh scent of the forest and the refreshing energy of the valley full of negative ions surround the whole body. After walking while enjoying the feeling, I can see the way down to the valley. Soak your feet in the valley for a moment. My feet are sore because it is out of the sun.
   <br/>
   Cool off the sweat and walk again. When I arrive at the hostel, people are quite visible. Unload your luggage and rush to the valley where the darkness falls.

   Even at the end of summer, it is hot during the day. In the midday heat, the raindrops that come and go are added, and the body is full of sweat and humid energy. I changed to the shorts I prepared and went straight into the valley.

   There is a valley right in front of the guest house. Large and small pebbles formed a stone field. The stream flows creating a stream, and the sound is refreshing. It's cool just by listening. Go into the water, lay a stone pillow, and lie down. The whole body flutters in the water passing through the back stem. The sound of the water passing through the earlobe is clear. The wind that has passed through the forest touches the body, so the goosebumps rise. The heat does not go away, but it takes a chill. The heat of sweat and moisture blends with the heat, and the feeling of sticking to the body flies away. It is not long and comes out of the water.
   <br/>
   Since it is a deep mountain valley, darkness comes early. The lights are lit one by one in the guest house and the smell of cooking spreads over the valley.

   Prepare dinner with a clear and refreshing body and mind. Boil samgyetang with chicken from Hyundong. You have to cook for an hour, but during that time, you cheat the market with ramen.
   <br/>
   Suddenly the valley was full of darkness. It is the world of people until the light of the street light in front of the guest house. The valley and forest beyond the light is a world of beasts. Sometimes the sound of a beast is heard in the dark forest. As the wind gets stronger, the sound of wind passing through the forest is ugly. The sound of the valley water is also louder than during the day. At first, these sounds were strange and anxious, but as I got used to it, I felt comfortable.

    I eat late the next morning and go out. The lodging is in the middle of the valley, so I saw only half of the valley yesterday. Go further up the valley from the hostel.

    Water flows over the small beams created to cross the valley. The water falling from the beam breaks white. The light color and bright sound shining in pale jade are cool.

   A tree that looks like a Christmas tree forms a forest, and water fogs bloom in the valley flowing between the forests. It is the best view of the Guma-dong Valley promenade from yesterday to today. I just can't pass, and I go into the landscape. Soak your feet in the valley and sit for a while.
   <br/>
   As you go up the water, you meet a wide field. It may be the widest land in the Gumadong Valley. A villager who met there tells an old story of the Gumadong Valley.

   It is said that during the Japanese colonial period, gold was mined from the gold mine and trees were cut from the dense forest. It was the site of resource looting. It is said that about 150 households lived along the valley in the height. There were one elementary school each downstream and upstream of the valley. Since there are a lot of people, there were three main curtains. It is said that the vicinity of the elementary school that became closed school and the site of Norumok Serumam were famous streets.

   After walking through the old story of the Gumadong Valley, my step back to the hostel is slow. Small life in valleys and forests that were invisible when coming, comes into sight. Butterflies flutter in the grass, and bees fly on flowers that bloom on cliffs. Like a step, my mind is relaxed.
