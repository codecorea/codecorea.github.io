    Old ones always stimulate fragrance. Museums that remodel old warehouses are more attractive than sophisticated museums of high-tech architecture. The Korean Modern Literature Museum opened in the cultural district of Incheon Port, which is filled with modern culture. This is the only literary museum that encompasses Korean modern literature. On the outer wall, the time and frivolity of the old warehouse remain unchanged.

    The cultural district of the opening port of Jung-gu, Incheon, strangely resembles Brooklyn, New York. It is similar to remodeling an old warehouse and using it as a gallery and workshop for artists, and it is similar that the muzzle and railroad tracks in and out of containers are entangled. When you step up to the free park behind the cultural district, you can see the railroads leading to the sea and Incheon Station, shabby warehouses and art spaces, and panoramic views of old houses. The Korean Modern Literature Museum was opened this fall at the cultural district of the opening port of Asrahan.

   The Korean Museum of Modern Literature is a place where Incheon City and Incheon Cultural Foundation reorganized the warehouse of logistics for 100 years as a literary museum from a humanistic perspective. The museum contains the old warmth. The atmosphere of the old port is looming from the sluggish exterior walls and wooden ceilings of the warehouse built during the Japanese occupation.

   The Literature Museum also saved the significance of modern history ten minutes. The Incheon Open Port is where the modern culture of Incheon, a port city, still lives and breathes. The Museum of Modern Literature is the only Korean literature that preserves modern literature from the Enlightenment Period of the 1890s to the late 1940s. Although there are about 60 literary museums in Korea, it is the only literary museum that encompasses modern literature, leaving a certain literary and religious school.

   The Korean Museum of Modern Literature has nearly 30,000 items. You can encounter the works of literary artists such as Choi Nam-sun, Han Yong-woon, Kim So-wol, Nado-hyang, Hyun Jin-geon, Baekseok, Yeom Sang-seop, etc. The strange scent of the spirit springs up from faded rare texts, such as the first edition of Korea's first Korean-language mix, Yu Gil-jun's 《Seoul Yomunmun》, and Yeom Sang-seop ’s 《Mansejeon》.

   The visit to the Museum of Modern Literature starts with a special exhibition of later writers. Hwang Soon-Woo's 'Treasure Warehouse' exhibition is an exhibition that contains traces of bricks and wood buried in walls and ceilings in the process of reconstructing a newly built warehouse building as a literary museum. This special exhibition will continue until November 17th.

   At the permanent exhibition hall of the Literature Museum, you can examine the history and major works of literature by period. With the period of Enlightenment, Taedonggi of Modern Literature, and Kim So-wol and Han Yong-un, along with the period of social absurdity, poets and novels of literary people who have pinched social absurdity can be appreciated. The most prominent space in the exhibition hall is the place where the faces of literary artists are gathered all over the wall.

   The area near the Korean Modern Literature Museum is a space for viewing the cultural district of the open port. In fact, on weekends, Chinatown, which is crowded with restaurants selling Jjajangmyeon, is a busy place. If you want to enjoy the quiet old-time buildings and artworks and enjoy a quiet stroll, the road opposite the Freedom Park leading to Jung-gu Office is good. As you enter the alleyway of the cultural district, the teahouses that entered the old Japanese houses are warm, and the buildings that transformed from the banks to museums during the opening of the port, such as the Open Port Museum and the Modern Architecture Center, stand out. The tea houses have a cozy atmosphere that old literary people might have stopped by. In fact, nearby Wolmido and Freedom Park also served as backgrounds for literary works. Yeom Sang-seop portrayed the atmosphere of the opening port at the time in his novel, "Issim", published in 1928.

  <div class="txt_p">
   “The car ran around the coast where the man was double-stretched like a market day and ran to Manguk Park. But today it is also crowded with people. A group of secondary school students and a procession of female students are also seen in front. Perhaps these students are coming in to watch the concert. ”
   <br/>
   The path from the Modern Literature Museum to the Freedom Park through the Cultural Port of the Open Port is full of a deep autumn atmosphere. As you walk along the street, novels and poems from old literary artists hover around the streets to encourage speculation.
