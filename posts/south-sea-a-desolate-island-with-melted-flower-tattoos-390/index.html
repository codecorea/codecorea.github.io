   When you visit the South Sea on a warm spring day, your eyes turn to full color because of colorful flowers such as cherry blossoms, rapeseeds, and tulips. It is the site of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin's country, and it is also an island filled with the loneliness and despair of exiles. Walking through exotic German villages, the love of miners and nurses in the movie 'International Market' comes to mind.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Namhae Grand Bridge, representing Korea's economic growth in the 1970s. Opened in 1973, the South Sea has turned into an island, not an island. The red suspension bridge, 660m long and 80m high, is considered one of the most beautiful bridges in Korea. In addition, the Battle of Noryang, the last battle of the Imjin War, began, and it was also a place where many exiles boarded a ferry. When you cross the Namhae Grand Bridge and wind around the road, you will reach Noryang Village.

   If you visited this place in spring, order Dodari Mugwort from Noryang's sushi restaurant. If you put the fleshy legs on the scented mugwort that overcame the sea breeze, and boil it in a pot, the white broth will turn out, but there is no supplement. You can see the life-size turtle ship by touching the ship in fullness and heading towards the sea. Inside, you can see the weapons that defeated the enemy during the Imran. Behind it is Chungryulsa Temple. The place where the body of Admiral Yi Sun-sin, who was killed by the Merry Sea Battle, has been gathered for three months, is now constructed. It is said that the tombstone of this Chungmugong was built by Song Si-yeol of Uam and written by Song Jun-gil.

   Stone sculptures in the shape of a pan-ok line stand in the square of Yi Sun-sin Park, and the statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin stares into the sea in the middle. The best attraction is a large porcelain mural measuring 5m in height and 200m in length. A pottery was made by baking 3797 pieces of ceramic 50 cm wide and 50 cm long. It is said that baking it in a kiln transformed it and twisted it, making it more difficult to bake more than 8,000 pieces. The mural depicts a total of five scenes, including the appearance of the Noryang Naval Battle, the origin of the victory, the battle, the Sunkook, and what the South Sea looks like today.

   Horticultural arts village is a village where gardening experts gathered together and changed the house and garden like a picture.
