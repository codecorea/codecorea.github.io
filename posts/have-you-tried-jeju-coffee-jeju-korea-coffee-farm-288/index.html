    Coffee cultivation in Korea? Someone said that it was a difficult task. But it was not impossible at all. Before the spread of the coffee culture, those who had established the site in Jeju and quietly built a coffee plantation. The efforts of those years appeared as a valuable fruit of the birth of “Korea Coffee”. Jeju coffee, look into the new world.

   Realize the dream of Jeju coffee plantation

  <div class="txt_p">
   Coffee originates mostly in hot countries such as Africa and South America. Famous coffee farms are distributed between the North and South Hoewi around the equator. Korea, which is far from that category, is not really a suitable place for planting coffee trees.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   However, Roh Myeong-cheol, CEO of Korea Coffee Farm, had a different idea. I was convinced that if I had a certain amount of conditions, I could grow coffee in Korea. Even in the cold winter, it was not impossible to cultivate a plastic greenhouse so that the coffee trees could survive. When the sweet mix coffee was a major trend, he had already fallen in love with the coffee beans and planned to make a coffee plantation in Jeju. He loved coffee so much, but 'farming' was one of the things he was most confident and could do better than anyone else. Growing new crops to adapt to our soil and climate is also his specialty. The dream of Jeju coffee plantation that started like that has already entered the ninth year.

    Next to Taeheung Elementary School in Namwon-eup, a simple building with a red roof stands out. It is a cafe run by Korea Coffee Farm. A plastic house built next to it. Here, coffee trees producing 'Korea Coffee' from Jeju are growing. As soon as you enter the plastic house, moisture comes off the hook. No matter how good the day is, I didn't expect it to be so humid. There are trees all over the green house, and it feels like you have come to a coffee tree forest. There are a lot of seedlings sprouting from the coffee beans on the floor. It's still winter outside, but the spring is bright here.

   About 1,200 coffee trees are growing in this greenhouse. Trees that have been fully adapted to Jeju's climate and soil, have grown tremendously for nine years with the dream of President Roh Myung-cheol. It began harvesting coffee cherries two years ago, and is expected to produce about 800kg to 1 ton of green beans this year. Flowering buds will start to grow on each branch, and coffee cherries are expected to be harvested in April-May. In the case of artificial cultivation using a vinyl house, it is said that the production is doubled compared to the natural state.

KOREA COFFEE is stored in a parchment state, and it is fresh and neat because it is roasted with only the necessary amount. It doesn't have any other flavor, and the balance of various flavors makes it feel lighter. ” Nods are nodded by the explanation of CEO Roh. KOREA COFFEE, is a taste that I want to keep looking for.

    While tasting Korea coffee, Roh's wife brings another coffee.

By comparison, you can definitely feel the difference in taste. The more you drink, the more fresh the Korean coffee is.
