    Singer Cho Yong-pil sang. 'Flower camellia'. The camellia flowers that passed the peak of the season are covered in the trail at Dongbaek Park on Dongbaek Island next to Haeundae in Busan. The summit of Dongbaek Island, where the statue of Choi Chi-won was erected, is the flower palace. Dongbaek Park is a camellia tree along the ring road.

   If there are Camellia Hill in Jeju Island, Camellia Hill in Jeju Island, Jisimdo Island in Yeosu, Camellia Forest in Maryangri in Seocheon, and Camellia Forest in Okryongsaji in Gwangyang, Dongbaek Island in Haeundae-gu is the best place to visit. When you get off at Dongbaek Station or Haeundae Station on Busan Subway Line 2, you will soon reach Dongbaek Island, where camellia flowers have formed a cushion of flowers. If the spring breeze that wraps around the skyscrapers in Haeundae or Suyeong River blows a little from behind, the steps become lighter.

   The walking tour of Dongbaek Island is in front of the Westin Chosun Busan Hotel. At the entrance, there is a guide map of Dongbaek Park and a sign indicating the origin of Haeundae Dongbaek Island, which is a good guide for beginners. No matter which side you start walking on, you need to set the direction as you go. Most of the Nurimaru APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) houses turn to the right. This will keep the sea on the right hand side of the island.

   The faces of people walking on the Dongbaekseom loopway are consistently 'Yu-Yu-Ju-Yu'. Whether you are a citizen who lives in the air of Busan every day, a traveler on a KTX or Saemaul train, or a group of tourists from Southeast Asia, they walk the trails at their own pace and pace. Because the car does not go, the couple pushing the stroller is also noticeable. When various types of camellia flowers, such as Camellia, Camellia, and Camellia, pass under a tree hanging like an apple, they stop and take photos. It's too short for each person's chest, so it's a sad spring day.

    On the trail of Dongbaek Island, you cannot find camellia flowers that fell on the road. I turned my head and looked inside the fence, and they all gathered there. This is because the people who clean the trails sweep the camellia flowers that have fallen to the ground with people's sneakers or shoehorns, sweeping them with a broomstick that looks like they might scream. There is a brilliant tomb of Camellia. So camellia blooms twice. Once, it hangs on a tree and blooms in full bloom. When it dies, it does not scatter one leaf and two leaves, but it falls apart and blooms once more. People love the camellia flower because it has a thick line like this and does not act obsessively to prolong life. At this point, I think of a time when Seongsammun, a Bachelor of Jeon Hyun-jeon during King Sejong in Joseon, made a camellia flower.

   Steps suddenly reach the Nurimaru APEC House. As soon as you step inside, it is Kim Kyu-jang's masterpiece &lt;Twelve Jangsaengdo&gt;. This is a Najeon lacquer painting that adds two things to a teenager, and it is very large (6m × 2.2m) and colorful. Let's look at each one that appears. Sun, clouds, mountains, rocks, water, cranes, deer, turtles, pine trees, and bullochos have been added to bamboo and nectarine peaches to become twelve. When I visited it before, I just passed by, but this spring, I open it one by one, so I feel the flow of time.

   Nurimaru, which introduced Korea's traditional concept of pavilion, has a good view from the observation deck with a small lighthouse. On the right, you can see Gwangan Bridge and Igidae Park at a glance with a round roof of Nurimaru, on the left, and the sea and the back. It is 500 meters from the entrance of Dongbaekseom Island and is boldly marked with white paint at the bottom of the road. On the Observation Deck, a photographer is taking a commemorative photo of travelers who have not brought a camera.

   A telescope is also installed on the observation deck. Oryukdo (6 islands at high tide and 5 at low tide) is floating in front of the nose. Let's take a look at what is written on the observation deck information board.
   <p>
    It is estimated that the average Tsushima Island can be seen in Busan on average 60 days a year. There is a theory that "the Tsushima Island seen from Busan is likely to be a kind of mirage caused by the refraction of light caused by the difference in temperature between regions."

    Which theory is correct? Another signboard stands next to it. The title is ‘Boilak Malak Tsushima Secret’. It's fun to read every single line without looking at it. "The distance between Busan and Tsushima is 65km, but the fact that the entire coastline is visible, even if the weather is clear, exceeds the limits of human vision, and is likely to be a mirage," wrote an article in the Busan Daily.

   The Observation Deck is located at the turn point of Dongbaekseom Island. If you move your seat to a deck installed on a coastal cliff with a good view of Haeundae next door, you can find a stone carving called “Haeundae”. Designated as Busan National Monument No. 45, this stone carving is said to be written by Goun Choi Chi-won (857 ~?), A scholar and writer of the late Unified Silla.

   When a fine teacher went to Mt. Gaya in the last years, he passed through this place and left the word “Haeundae” on a large rock under the cliff against the beautiful scenery. The name continues to this day. The stone carvings seen between camellia trees are in a state where the luck is somewhat worn out after experiencing the weather for many years.

   Even after turning around, the feast of camellia flowers continues. The acquaintance, who said, “If you want to feel the spring of Busan in full body, take a walk around Dongbaek Island,” was never empty. With the camellia forest on the right side and walking towards the starting point, a bad smell like a sewer irritates the nose. Some say it smells like chicken. It is the scent that spreads through the white flowers of Sasraepi amongst the camellia forest.
