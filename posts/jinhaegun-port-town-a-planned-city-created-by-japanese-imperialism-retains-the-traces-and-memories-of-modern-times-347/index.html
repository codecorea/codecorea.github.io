   In 1926, during the Japanese colonial rule, Jinhae Station (Registered Cultural Festival No. 192) was established.

   Modern cultural heritage on a radial eight-pronged road
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Jungwon Rotary is eight-pronged in the radial direction along the grass square. In 1912, Japanese imperialism was created to make it a military port city and a planned city in Korea on a wide, oily field called 'Jungpyeong Handeul'. In the process, the natives were forced out, and the newly formed city was left entirely Japanese. This is the reason why Japanese-style modern buildings are crowded around Jungwon Rotary.
   <br/>
   The travel route is counterclockwise with the 'culture space black and white' as seen from the northwest of Jungwon Rotary. Black and white, as its name suggests, has a sharp contrast between white walls, black window frames, and front door frames. It was a classic music cafe opened in 1952 under the name 'Kalmen'. The Black &amp; White Cafe was loved as a cultural center in Jinhae, where there were no cultural spaces deserved at the time by holding music appreciation and art exhibitions. Currently, it is being used as a civil cultural space by holding regular concerts.

The fighter was an American bomber that dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. In front of Jinhae-gun Port Village History Museum is Marksa Street. Since Jinhae is a city of military port, it is a place where mark companies that put marks and name tags on the soldier's military uniforms are gathered together.

   In the 1980s, the current owner took over Younghaeru and changed it to Wonhaeru. Of the two signs on the front of the building, the upper part would be Younghaeru and the lower one would be wanted. The sign of Yeonghaeru is also the first letter of the original letter, which was changed by operating it as Wonhaeru. If you look closely, you can see the difference between the letters next to it.
