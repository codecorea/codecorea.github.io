    There is no need to hesitate to go to Bukchon even on a sunny day. Going out on a cloudy or snowy day goes well. At least, after watching Hong Sang-soo's movie &lt;Bukchon Direction&gt;. In black and white, Bukchon captures the daily and winter memories of 'movie fighters'. &lt;Bukchon direction&gt; is &lt;Oh! Sujeong&gt; Since then, it is Hong Sang-soo's second black-and-white film, which also advances to the Cannes Film Festival.

   In fact, Bukchon's popularity has skyrocketed these days. Even in the middle of winter, people who come and go in the hanok alley are still walking. It has become a regular course for tourists from Japan and China to visit when visiting Seoul.
   <br/>
   "I'm sorry, but there are Chinese and Japanese guides, but there is no Korean version." The clothes of the guide helper on the alley in Bukchon are pink. It stands out from a distance, but for a moment, I think for a moment that it doesn't go well with a scene in a movie or Hanok.
   <br/>
   In &lt;Bukchon direction&gt;, Yoo Joon-sang (Seongjun station), Kim Sang-jung (Yeongho station), and Song Seon-mi (Boram station) are former film directors, film critics, and professors. Yoo Joon-sang, who played the lead role, seems to be about Hong Sang-soo's self-portrait.

   A trip to Bukchon in harmony with &lt;Bukchon direction&gt; may start from the intersection of Anguk Station, or start with a car at Jeongdok Library. Both are places where the film was set. In front of the Jeongdok Library, they had a chat by drinking coffee written by Joon-sang Yoo and Sang-joong Kim, and Gilmok between Anguk Station and the Constitutional Court appeared as usual with drunken soldiers in the movie. When it comes to repeating places, you can't miss the Korean restaurant 'Dajeong' and the bar and cafe 'Novel'. The actual atmosphere is similar to the movie scene.

   "It's not that the filmmakers come often. Hong Sang-su is the regular here. I also filmed the next movie with Mr. Ja-ok Kim."
   <br/>
   In the words of Hanjeongsik's aunt, it seems that you can see 'Dajeong', which the main characters have enjoyed in Hong's next film. On the back wall of 'Dajeong', there is a large poster attached to the place where &lt;Bukchon direction&gt; was filmed. The herbs, Bossam, and Haejangguk are delicious. The directors say that they will never eat anything that tastes bad, no matter how much they eat it.

   The movie &lt;Bukchon Direction&gt; is interesting because it does not contain the common sights of Bukchon. If the Bukchon Cultural Center or Hanok Street was projected as a long take, the movie might have been a bit frustrating. On the screen, alleys, restaurants, and pubs that people come and go on a daily basis are simply mixed.

   The cafe 'Novel' passed through Jaedong Elementary School and entered the back alley of the Myeongin Art Museum. It would not have been easy to find a space in a movie that had entered a dead end without a signboard with only the palm of the novel. As in the movie, the owner of the novel is temporarily absent. The place where Sung Joon (Jun Sang Yoo) played the piano, exchanged farms with the owner of the cafe, and fell in love is the 'novel'.

   The places that set the background for the film slowly fill the corners of Bukchon. As you walk, Bukchon's specialty comes out naturally. These days, the Bukchon walk is conducted with various themes. There are also good places to take a commemorative photo called 'Bukchon Eight Views'.

   The hanok alley in the 31st district of Gahoe-dong is the best preserved hanok in Bukchon. The Gye-dong alley from the modern office building to the Jungang High School contains the lives of old residents, such as old baths, clinics, and barber shops. In addition to this, Bukchon's main walking course is the Gahoe-dong workshop alley with open hanoks and workshops, the Sagan-dong gallery alley with galleries, and the school alley in front of Deokseong Girls' High School, where many restaurants are located. If you take a simple route called 'Bukchon Walk' before going on a walk in the alley, it will serve as a good guide.

   The movie &lt;Bukchon direction&gt; ends like this. Seongjun, who was roaming Bukchon without a job, stumbles upon his fan (Hyunjeong Jung) to become a photo model. Behind the awkward-looking protagonist, an old alley map of Bukchon is captured by the camera side by side.
