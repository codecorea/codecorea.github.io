   As its name suggests, makgeolli means ‘just filtered alcohol’. With such condensed milk, our wine, which is sometimes treated as insignificant alcohol, is soothing sour with soju and beer. It is a liquor that has been enjoyed by everyone who has been made and tasted since ancient times. However, if you visit his taste and history, you will never be able to treat him lightly.

   Now that you have found a traditional brewery, let's try making a drink. First, steam the godubap, called sulbab. When the godubap is finished, spread it gently and cool it. This is because the heat of godubap kills yeast. When fermenting the liquor, the fever is produced by the activity of the yeast, which is stirred in the middle to prevent the temperature from rising.
