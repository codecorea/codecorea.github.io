    Located in the central inland, Jecheon is a small town. It is perfect for quiet walking around. Recently, it has emerged as a city of movies and dramas. The police station set of the Visual Media Center, Cheongpungho and Uirimji area bring together the beauty and scenery of Jecheon and the memories of the movie.

   The end of the film &lt;Parkha Candy&gt; was a scene that would remain in the movie history. It is not an exaggeration to say that the scene that made today's movie star Seol Kyung-goo. It is near Jinso village in Baekwoon-myeon, Jecheon-si. It is located above the elevated railroad in Chungbuk Line between Gongjeon Station and Samtan Station. There are two forked bridges, which are in front of the tunnel through the middle of the cliff. At the time of shooting, it was remote. After the movie was successful, the road opened and the number of vehicles increased. Pensions have also entered quite a few. The movie changed the village. Since it was a 1999 work, it was 14 years ago.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   &lt;Parkha Candy&gt; was a flare. Since then, many movies and dramas have visited Jecheon. Local small towns' unique feelings and moods sometimes exist as a set of movies. Several factors have also been added. The first is a train. Jecheon is the starting point of the Central Inland Circulation Train (O-Train). The central inland circulation train is a circular train that connects the three provinces of central inland. Departing from Jecheon, Chungbuk, passes Yeongju, Gyeongbuk, and Taebaek, Gangwon-do. You can feel the beauty of Baekdu-daegan. It's a movie-like train journey.

   The second is the movie itself. It's not just a movie, it's a music movie. It is composed of music or music. Jecheon hosts international film festivals representing Korea, along with Busan, Bucheon, and Jeonju. Jecheon International Music Film Festival. This year, it opened on August 14th (Wed) and held six days until Monday (19th). Movie fans who simply visited to enjoy the music festival are immersed in the city's fascination around the end of the festival. So, I visit Jecheon once again. This is to meet Jecheon again as a travel destination, not a movie city of Jecheon. In that case, I recommend taking a trip to a filming or drama location filmed in Jecheon. Most of Jecheon's main filming locations are Jecheon's famous travel destinations.

   Gathering of movie information, spring of Jecheon Media Center
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The first step in traveling to the Jecheon Filming Site is to start from the Jecheon Film Media Center in spring. It is a place that holds various information of the movie city Jecheon. The old Jecheon City Council building was remodeled and opened in 2008. In particular, the office of the Cheongpung Film Commission, which discovers and introduces the location of Jecheon, is located. It is often difficult to find the exact location of the filming location, but you can also get help such as the location and transportation of filming locations, movies, and dramas that are being released recently.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Traces of filming also exist within the center. This is the police station set inside. Many of the recent movies, such as &lt;Howling&gt;, &lt;Broken Arrow&gt;, and &lt;Kan Ki Nam&gt;, are set by the Jecheon Video Media Center. It is also released to the general public, but the detailed settings are not usually made, so you can only feel the atmosphere. At the entrance on the first floor, movies and drama posters taken in Jecheon have filled the inner walls. &lt;Wagon&gt;, &lt;Gone with the Wind&gt;, &lt;Chosunyeong Detective&gt;. In front of the stairs going up to the second floor, there is a new prop, the main prop of the movie &lt;Shinkijeon&gt;. &lt;Shin Ki-jeon&gt; by Jung Jae-young is a 2008 work. It dealt with the production process of Shinkijeon, a rocket propulsion arrow made during the Joseon Dynasty. A set was built in the mountains of Geumseong-myeon and photographed. At the time of filming, Dr. Chae Seok-yeon, a researcher at the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, restored a new mechanism and gathered attention. The new mechanism in the center was donated by the production company to Jecheon City. The production plan written in &lt;Army Prayer&gt; in &lt;&lt; National Ordinance of the Ordinance&gt; is attached like a manual.

   Cheongpungho is the best place to travel in Jecheon. Cheongpung Lake is an artificial lake created by the construction of Chungju Dam. The same lake is called Chungjuho in Chungju and Cheongpungho in Jecheon. It is called the inland sea because it has the largest size after Soyang Lake. Bibongsan Mountain, Geumsusan Mountain, Insan Mountain, etc. are combined with the spectacular waterways of Namhan River to form a superb view.

   Cheongpung Lake is about a 30-minute drive from downtown Jecheon. It is only a lakeside when you get out of downtown and enter Geumseong-myeon. It is also suitable as a drive course. The Cheongpung Lake is carried whenever the recording path is curved. The first pass is the lakeside KBS shooting set. Filmed major historical dramas of KBS such as &lt;Taejo Wang Geon&gt;. Now closed. Cheongpungho was once a mecca for Korean historical dramas, but after rumors as a destination, its momentum diminished. Rather, the shooting of modern theater has increased than that of historical drama. Rather than building a new set, it captures the beautiful nature of Cheongpungho. The drama &lt;Shark&gt; starring Son Ye-jin and Kim Nam-gil is typical.

   After passing KBS filming location, it is the way to Muamsa Temple on the left. In the past, there was a &lt;Shingijeon&gt; set near Muamsa Temple. This also has lost functionality now. Before the Muam Valley and Muamsa Temple, they passed through the Muam Reservoir (Muam No. 1). As you move from the road toward the reservoir, you will find a small vacant lot on the waterside surrounded by mountains. There is a lonely tree towards the lake. The scenery of the tranquil lake catches the heart. In the drama &lt;Shark&gt;, this is the lakeside next to the villa where Han Yi-soo (Kim Nam-gil) and Jo Ha-woo (Sun Ye-jin) secretly encountered. It is a space suitable for expressing the secret feelings of love and hatred entangled between the two main characters.

   On the one side of the reservoir, the water path of the Muam Valley is also teeming. It is not a professional camping ground, but there are also a few people who enjoy camping with tents. Ahead of the release, starring Ha Ji-won's &lt;Chosun Beauty Three Musketeers&gt; and Cha Tae-hyun's &lt;Gone with the Wind&gt; were also filmed in Muamsa and Muam Reservoir. In terms of the scenery of the trip, Muamsa or Valley is better, but Muam Reservoir is a fascinating image of the movie.

   After exiting Muam Reservoir of &lt;Shark&gt;, go to Cheongpung Cultural Foundation and Cheongpung Monorail. It is a travel destination that retains the gorgeous scenery of Cheongpungho. On the way, there is also Cheongpung Land, and it is better to meet Cheongpung Cultural Foundation and Cheongpung Monorail at sunset.

   When you cross Cheongpung Bridge, Cheongpung Cultural Foundation emerges. The cultural assets of Cheongpung, which were in danger of sinking with the Chungju Dam, were collected and created. Climb the foot of the mountain while looking at the remains of the overpass, pavilion, and dolmen. From the top, the panoramic view of Cheongpungho is embraced as a 360-degree panorama. The red baekilhong on each way to climb makes the Cheongpung Cultural Foundation of this time stand out more. Interesting trees like the heart tree and the thinking tree are also interesting. The Cheongpung Cultural Foundation had a SBS historical drama set site just two years ago. I filmed &lt;Awaiting&gt;, &lt;Iljimae&gt;, and &lt;Jang Gil-san&gt;, but it was recently demolished. You can't look into the stage of an old historical drama directly, but the outstanding nature of Cheongpungho, which forms the background, is enough comfort.

   Fortunately, a larger scale facility overlooking the Cheongpung Lake was created. It is Cheongpung Monorail that entered last year. Originally used for transporting paragliding equipment to the summit of Bibongsan, it was developed for tourism. It operates 7 cars and travels 3km away in 23 minutes one way. The monorail climbs to the top of Bibongsan Mountain at 531 meters above sea level. The view from the top is too undue to climb easily. Mt. Seollang, Seongbong, Guksabong, and Daedeoksan create a delightful landscape.

   If you have a leisurely time, Jardrock Road is also recommended. It is a path that walks through the mountainous village of Cheongpungho, and is made of 7 courses, including a small Dongsan-gil, Jeongbangsa-gil, and Ice Valley Ecological Road. There are many walks along the lake, creating a unique scenery. The short course takes 90 minutes and the long course takes 280 minutes. Then, visit Cheongpung Land at sunset.

   During sunset, go to Cheongpung Land (Resort) again. The parking lot filmed a scene from the movie Radio Star. Singer Choi Gon (Park Jung-hoon) and manager Park Min-soo (An Sung-ki) shared a cup of coffee and regained their righteousness. The lonely middle-aged life is exquisitely matched with the glow of the blue wind. The sunset in Cheongpung Land is the best. It is an unprecedented view from the inland sea. The shadows of the mountains formed by Bibongsan Mountain, Indeungsan Mountain, and Keimyung Mountain across the lake make you lose your words. It makes my heart beat like a romance in a movie. As you go down the lake, there are extreme leisure facilities next to the lakeside stage. The country's tallest 62m bungee jump, the country's first ejection seat, and the country's longest 1.4km cable coaster (zip line) bring exciting excitement.

   After watching the sunset in Cheongpung Land, head to Urimim not far from downtown Jecheon. Along with Cheongpungho, it is a must-see and travel destination in Jecheon. Uirimji is the oldest reservoir in Korea along with Gimje Byeokgolje and Miryang Fisheries. It is said to have been built for the first time during the King of Singa Jinheung. Currently, it is faithful to the role of an amusement park with parklands and trails. Around the pond, pine trees and weeping willows add luck. It is popular as a dating spot for lovers, like &lt;The Secret Charm of Female Professors&gt;. In the daytime, it is also worth visiting Solim Park in Uirimji, where you shot the scene of the gang's picnic. However, the late night reservoir walk is also indispensable. Uirimji is one of the most beautiful night views in Jecheon. It is not just a night view, but a night scenery that you can feel while walking slowly. Since it is held at the tiptoe, it captures Jecheon's travel to Sinab.
