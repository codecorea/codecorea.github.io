   For several years, the fever of tvn &lt;Youth over Flowers&gt; has been strong. The ringing was loud for the cast and men in their 20s and 40s. In the meantime, there were many bad trips (?) For men's trips. However, &lt;Youth over Flowers&gt; harmonized with men's sticky friendship and the theme of 'challenge', dreaming of a healthy trip with friends.

   Surfing satisfies both themes of 'friendship' and 'challenge'. Surfing in Hawaii or the Gold Coast is a misunderstanding if you think that surfing on the Internet is only a matter of other countries. There are more surf spots in Korea than I thought, including Yangyang Jukdo, Taean Manripo, Pohang Chilpo, and Jeju Jungmun. The equipment is also simple and relatively easy to access. It is no longer left as one of the bucket lists. It will be a challenge to meet your friends. There is nothing better than this, as we learn together and build up friendships.

   Among them, Busan Songjeong Beach is a good place to start surfing. Since the South Sea and the East Sea meet, the south swell from spring to summer and the northeast swell in winter can enjoy surfing in all seasons. In addition, the waves of the knee are frequent and the lessons are conducted at the depth of the waist, making it perfect for beginners to surf. Currently, about 10 surf schools and equipment rental companies have entered the beach. Local surfers have already emerged since the late 1990s, and almost 20 years have passed. International surfing competitions have been held since 2009. It is worthwhile to be a mecca of surfing in Korea.

   Ground exercises are conducted on sandy beaches. The basic movements of the surf are paddle padding to paddle with your arms when the waves come in, push-ups to raise your upper arms to reach the waves, and take-offs to raise your knees to the lower body, finally balancing and riding the waves Is divided into Repeat this motion on the sandy beach to wear it. It is boring, but the performance of practice is directly related to the practice. Of course, I usually realize this after a few bumps on the water.

   At first, the water practice is on the board with the help of the instructor, rather than speeding up with paddling. At this time, the position of the foot on the board, the gaze, and the process of quickly converting from push-up to take-off are important. Repeat this a few times and notice the timing of the waves. Quick learners stand on the board in two or three turns and ride the waves.

   On the second day, start with paddling and practice climbing yourself. If the board focuses on going straight in by the 2nd day, from the 3rd day, challenge the side riding on the oblique side of the wave surface. Day 4-5 is the process of deepening what you have learned until day 3. The cost is around 65,000 won on the first day and 150,000 won on the third day, including equipment rental. Personal training is only possible after learning at least 3 days. Of course, after the 1st day experience, most of them continue until the 3rd day.

   Surfing is very special because it slides on the water. It is a pleasure that you have never felt before. It has a different charm than a snowboard running on a snowy field. It's hard to break up once you fall into the charm that flows like a fish over the waves. "Surfing is like a mob. Once you're in there, there's no exit," said Kelly Slater, former World Surfer (WSL) champion. Surfing is a passionate and fascinating report.

   The class time is about 3 hours per day. Starting in June, you can overlap with the surfers, so you will teach in the surf zone. In the summer, there are many people who want to learn to surf, so it's a good idea to challenge before the peak season begins. Some companies, such as Surfholic, lend their equipment and help them practice personally even after the class is over until May.

   Surfing is not greatly affected by the weather. It is good to surf in the rain on a rainy day. You can't swim because you wear a buoyant suit. In addition, the surfboard is connected to the ankle with a leash cord, making it easy to manage underwater. Preparations include a swimsuit, light toiletries and sunscreen. Beginners are advised to make a reservation after confirming in advance as low tide time is safe. Children can challenge if they are over 135cm tall.

   After surfing, go to Songjeong Station on the East Sea Nambu Line at the entrance of the beach. Songjeong Station was opened in 1934 and was designated as a registered cultural property in 2006. In 2013, the Donghae Nambu Line reached its end of life and lost the function of the station. I can feel the faded time everywhere. Currently, it is operated as a citizen gallery.

They go through short tunnels and walk while looking at the sea. Either from Songjeong Station or Mipo, it takes 40 minutes to Cheongsapo Saegil and the rest of the trip takes about 40 minutes.
