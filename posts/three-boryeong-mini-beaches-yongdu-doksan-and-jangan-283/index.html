    Boryeong city in Chungnam has tourist attractions such as Oseo Mountain and Boryeong Lake in the inland, Daecheon Beach and Muchangpo Beach on the coast. The Daecheon Beach is the site of the Boryeong Mud Festival, and the Muchangpo Beach is famous for opening the sea of mystery. That's why summer vacationers visit a lot. If you are planning a summer resort on the beach of Boryeong, look back at Yongdu, Doksan, and Jangan. Accommodations, restaurants, public transportation, toilets, and showers are more inconvenient than Daecheon or Muchangpo, but are said to be a suitable summer resort for those who want a relatively less crowded beach.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Daecheon Beach, which is considered as the first view in the 8th Boryeong view, is famous for its white sand beach. It is 3.5km north-south and about 100m wide. Centered on the Mud Square (formerly known as the Women's Square), it is divided into a fountain square in the north and a citizen tower square in the south. In the summer season, cruise ships sail from Mud Square to an island called Davodo, an uninhabited island floating 4km ahead. A gravel beach is formed in Davo Island. Between the Civic Tower Square and Solbat Beach Campground, there was a Boryeong Mud Experience Center. The first floor is the Mud Experience Center, and the second floor is the Mud Promotion Hall. At the fountain square, the music fountain with beautiful lighting at night will entertain visitors.

   It is a fault that Daecheon Beach, which has all good conditions, is one of the three major beaches on the west coast. In order to avoid the hustle and bustle, you need to cross the Nampo Seawall (about 3.7km in length) starting at the southern end of the Daecheon Beach entrance. Construction of the seawall began in 1985 and was completed in 1997. The Jukdo tourist spot in the middle of the seawall (8th out of the 8th Boryeong) is also worth a visit. There is a port where fishing boats and fishing boats are portrayed, and sashimi restaurants serving tourists are a successful island.

   The Yongdu Beach hidden at the southern end of the Nampo Embankment was a secluded place where the citizens of Boryeong visited without a rumor when Daecheon Beach occupied tourists. But now it has become an old saying. Although the beach is about 1km long, it boasts a cozy taste instead. In particular, Songlim is lush behind the beach, and is loved as a camping ground for vacationers. Although the pine trees are not thick, the population is so large that the sky cannot be seen.

   Behind the pine forest in the center of Yongdu Beach, there is a lodging facility called Dongbaekgwan (041-933-4005), built in red brick. The general welfare center operated by Boryeong-si was opened in 1996, and the facility was somewhat old. It has a 200-seat restaurant and meeting room, and there are 33 rooms on the first floor, including three (group rooms), two on the second floor, and three on the third floor. Dongbaekgwan operates a shower and a camping site until August for those who visit Yongdu Beach. The usage fee for a shower is 1,100 won for adults and 550 won for children, and a camping tent is cheap for 3,300 won per day for a tent for 4 people (4 pyeong).
   <br/>
   Wait here, let's go to know the origin of Nampo. It is estimated as the Goryeo Dynasty. Here, there were frequent appearances of Japanese dwarf on the beach. Then an old man discovered a secret. The fact that those boring dwarves love fugu! A blowfish that eats the petals of an indigo plant is fatal to a person. The people planted a lot of sesame seeds on the beach in front of them to get rid of the Japanese dwarf. After that, I started to write the letter “nam” in the place name. The shrine of the folks who tried to subdue the Japanese pufferfish was highlighted.

    After exiting Yongdu Beach, take the prefectural road 607 to the south, and you will see Muchangpo Beach, Doksan Beach, and Jangan Beach. It is Seocheon-gun, famous for ramie, when crossing the busan seawall at the entrance of Jangan Beach.
    <br/>
    I visit the beach in Chungnam, but no matter how busy I am, I cannot miss the Muchangpo Beach. Muchangpo Beach, the second of the 8 Boryeong sights, was opened in 1928. The sandy beach is 1.5km long and 50m wide. It is the second most popular beach in Boryeong after Daecheon. Here, there is a 1.5km sea route to Seokdae Island in front of the beach around the moon and eve of the moon every month. The phenomenon of seawater splitting itself is mysterious and you can catch crabs, seashells, sea cucumbers, sea shells, and octopus along the exposed sea path, so tourists will never stop.

    Doksan Beach is located to the south of Muchangpo Beach. It is also called Holmö Beach. It is impressive that there is a small hill in the middle of the beach that is mistaken for an island. On the beach, which is only about 10 m wide, you can see Jangan Beach and Busa Beach in the south and Doksan Beach in the north. It's a good place for a greedy traveler to be able to hold two beaches in the arms without a few steps.

   At the northern end of Doksan Beach, a cape called “Chicken Rice Stalk” protrudes from the Muchangpo Beach and serves as a boundary line. The beach looks somewhat shorter than Muchangpo. A lot of family members visit and catch shellfish when it is time to drain. Families who have prepared ice boxes, ranch packs, salt, and onion nets are striking. Local residents are urged to catch properly because it is an act that destroys the environment.
   <br/>
   If you need to go straight to Doksan Beach without visiting any other place, you should go out to Muchangpo IC instead of Daecheon IC. There are quite a few accommodations and restaurants on this beach.

    Jangan Beach, located at the southernmost point of Boryeong, is a beach hidden at the beginning of the quasi-dwelling. On a weekday morning, a group of seagulls is the owner of a rare sandy beach. This place is also rumored to be a clam catcher. However, it is more important than a well-behaved beach. The north beach of Jangan Beach is the 'Sohwangsa-gu' ecological learning site. There is a signboard at the entrance to the beach, so take a look. Along the ecological trail made of wooden decks, there are a cluster of seaweed flowers and a corresponding village, and if you walk further, you can see a community of bands, a village of Gojirisacho, and a community of seaweed wind. Sohwang Wetland, Sohwang Sand Dune, and Songlim Colony with Haesong are important resources for Jangan Beach.

   If you want to meet some inland destinations after enjoying water on the beach, you can also visit the Coal Museum, Seongjusaji Temple, and Seongjusan Natural Recreation Forest. Boryeong City is a famous coal producing area as well as Jeongseon or Taebaek in Gangwon Province, and the Coal Museum was built. You can see everything about coal through the process of coal generation, the use of coal, and mining village models. If you take the elevator effect that operates for 60 seconds, you will experience the experience of going down to the tunnel below 400m underground.

    If you go to Seongjusaji (Historic Site No. 307) near Seongjusan Natural Recreation Forest, you will fall in love with the exploration of our site. It was founded in the name of Ohabsa during the Baekje King. During the reign of the Unified Shilla Era, the name of the Sung Dynasty changed to Seongju during the reign of the Tang Dynasty Confucian School. At the temple site, there are still the Sunghyesaji Nanghyehwa Pagoda Monument (National Treasure No. 8), the five-storied stone pagoda, the central three-story stone pagoda, and the east and west three-storied stone pagoda.
