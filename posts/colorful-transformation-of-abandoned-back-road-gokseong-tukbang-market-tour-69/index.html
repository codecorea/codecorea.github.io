   Gokseong-gun. It is the place where the valley and the ashes were born as designated. Clear water and green mountains spread out everywhere. In recent years, there has been one more attraction in addition to the Qingsu Mt. Ttukbang Market, which enters once a month, is its main character. About 50 teams of sellers sell handmade crafts and jeonjeonburi on Gokseongcheon Ttukbanggil. Let's go to Gokseong Ttukbang Market, which is being reborn as 'the field of Jeolladomin unity'.

   Gokseong Dangbang Tukbang Market is a new flea market that opened in May. On the last Saturday of every month (2nd and 4th Saturday of every month from 2017), guests are welcomed for 5 hours on the Ttukbang path lined with cherry trees. Ttukbanggil, which has been abandoned for a long time because of its distance from major tourist attractions, began to enjoy its heyday with the arrival of Ttukbang Market. It played a big role in urban regeneration by helping tourists in the town limited to train villages. Tourists can also enjoy the unique atmosphere of Gokseongcheon, so there aren't any two birds.

   The road is not difficult. After setting the destination as Gokseong Train Village Traditional Market, you can park your car at the luxury building next door. When you get out of the car, you can see the crooked path with yellow sunshade behind the market. You can also take a bus instead of driving. It is only 500m away from Ttukbang Road and can be reached on foot.

   Why is it a yellow cloth? The answer is simple. This is because the yellow goes well with the fresh green of the cherry tree and the clear sky. There is also a reason that the soft and warm feeling of yellow is a good match with the image of Ttukbang Market, which is connected with local residents and tourists and has emerged as a place of communication.

   Some sellers chose to return home from the dentist's life. After taking free aroma courses for farmers, the company began to make and sell natural cosmetics such as moisture cream, cleansing oil, lip balm and toothpaste. The shelf life is not long enough to make products even on the morning of the market. The reason for this simple business is to see a younger man at an age when his head is grayed out. Hopefully later, if you have a big child, you thought, 'Mom did something for me.'

   The charm of Ttukbang Market is its low price and warm heart. Homemade snacks don't cost more than 5,000 won, and crops grown directly in the field are sold at a much lower price than the market. Calculations are made in cash only and sellers write receipts upon request. If you spend more than 10,000 won, you can get a prize by submitting a receipt to the organizer's table. Gifts of the day were buckets and fabric softeners.
