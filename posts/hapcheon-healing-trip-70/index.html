    Hapcheon has a quiet but beautiful scenery. Headed by the Haeinsa Temple at the foot of Gayasan, he prepared a healing trip to soothe the mind and body, focusing on Odosan Sunrise, Hapcheon Film Theme Park and Samga Hanwoo Street.

    What kind of locality is it? Hapcheon means “narrow mine”. If you read Chinese characters literally, it is Hyecheon. There are many mountains and no fields. The narrow valley surrounded by mountains is named after many topographical features. However, in March 1914, when the administrative district was reorganized, it was said that the sum of the three villages was combined as the basins of Chogye and Samga were incorporated into Hapcheon-gun. From then on, the Chinese characters were used as is, but the pronunciation was '합천'.

   Let's go from Mount Kaya (1430m), the northern gateway to Hapcheon. Gayasan is located on the border between Gyeongnam and Gyeongbuk. Gyeongnam Hapcheon reaches south and Seongju County Gyeongbuk reaches north. The highest name in the region where the gaya was located was called ‘Gayasan’. It was designated National Park No. 9 in 1972.

   The reason why Haeinsa is called “Law of Legal Affairs” is because it seals the Korean Colonial Police Commission. The name 'Palman Daegyeongkyeong' is presumed to come from the use of the name 'Palman Sacheon' when the Jang Kyung-pan's Jang Kyung-pan is also a Palman Woman and refers to so many things in Buddhism.

Even now, more than a dozen Korean cattle houses are gathered. You can taste fresh Korean beef for 20,000 won per serving (200g). If you're a vegetarian, keep in mind the wild vegetables located throughout the Gaya Mountains and Hapcheon. As it is a deep mountain valley, various mountain vegetables have been developed.
