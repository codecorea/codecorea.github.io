    King Gaero, who fell in love with King Jangsu, reached a miserable end under Achasanseong Fortress, and the grand Hanseong Baekje eventually collapsed. Woongjin is the place where King Munju of Baekje newly established the city. It is the princess now. It was a place where Baekje enjoyed its heyday for over 60 years until the city was moved back to Buyeo. In Gongju, there are Gomanaru scenic spots where you can walk around the history of Baekje, such as Gomanaru, Songsan Rigogun, and Communist Castle. Let's take a walk on Komanaru Myeongseung-gil where you can see the history of Baekje at once.

   The beginning of princess history, Komanaru with a sad legend
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    There is Gomnaru on the riverside of the princess. Woongjin, the old name of the princess, came from right here. Now called Komanaru, ‘Goma’ is the old term for ‘bear’, and the name of the princess starts here. A legend about bears and humans descends on Gomnaru. A female bear was living in Yeonmi Mountain, across from Gomnaru, where she caught a fisherman who caught a fish in Gomnaru and lived with her and gave birth to her young. One day, when a fisherman ran across the river and fled, the abandoned bear was sad and died in the water with the young. Since then, no fish have been caught in the river, and the Buddha has continued, such as death. People say that they built a bear shrine and sacrificed to relieve the grudge. It is a legendary story, but in fact, in 1975, a stone bear statue was discovered near Gomnaru. It is held every year at Woongshindan, located between the forests of Gomnararu. The excavated bear statue can now be found at the National Princess Museum. It is as cute as if you are folding your ears and floating a sheep.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   It is no wonder that the starting point of Gomanaru Myeongseung-gil is the Gomnaru, the birth of the princess. In Woongshindan, there is a bear statue, so the legend from the past feels like reality. Behind Woongsindan is a lush pine forest. As a reminder of the Gomnararu legend, you can find sculptures of female bears carrying two cubs all over the forest.

   Komanaru was designated as the number 21 scenic spot with a beautiful landscape, with a beautiful sandy beach along with Mt. However, now it is a pity that Gongju Bo was lost and the sandy beach was lost. Still, there is a beautiful pine forest. Beautiful pine trees that are full of red energy flutter randomly.

   Upon exiting Gomanaru, you will meet Gongju Hanok Village, the National Princess Museum, and Songsan Rigogun where King Muryeong is asleep. Gongju Hanok Village is a traditional hanok made of pine and cedar wood. In addition to various accommodation spaces, Hanok Village has an experience space where you can enjoy various traditional cultures, such as making props from Baekje artifacts and weaving Baekje books, and restaurants where you can enjoy traditional Korean cuisine, Gongju Gukbap, and night food. This is the best place to spend a day at Gongju and enjoy leisurely.

   Aside from the museum road leading through the museum to the remains of Jeongjisan Mountain, and the Gomanaru Myeongseung-gil, such as the Muryeong Wangreung-gil, Gomanaru-gil, and Gongsanseong-gil, it is worth walking along the Gongju Hanok Village. In particular, the remains of Jeongji Mountain, which meet through the back road of the National Princess Museum, are presumed to be the remains of a memorial service held at the national level during the Baekje period. Although it was hidden by the main ruins of the princess, such as the communist castle and Songsan Ligogun, it is designated as a historic site No. 474, so it is worth a visit. When you climb to the ruins of Jeongjisan, which is located on the Jeongjisan Tunnel, you can see the magnificent view of the communist castle in harmony with the old town of Baekje and the Geumgang Railway Bridge.

   National Princess Museum and Songsan Rigogun Meet Baekje in the Ungjin Era
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The National Princess Museum and Songsan Rigogun are indispensable places in Gongju. It is a place where you can meet the ruins of King Muryeong, representing the princess. The protagonist who bloomed the brilliant culture of the Ungjin era was King Muryeong. The discovery of the tomb of King Muryeong was a landmark event in Korea's archaeological excavations. Reminiscent of a drama from accidental discovery to excavation, King Muryeong awakened from a long sleep of more than 1,500 years. The tomb of King Muryeong was discovered in July 1971. It was the beginning of the great discovery that the water infiltrated inside the No. 6, which had been stolen during the Japanese occupation during the heavy rain, and then digged a ditch and caught it at the end of a shovel. It was a great excavation in the history of Korea and the first excavation of a Korean archaeologist, but the light of the world received by the king and queen, who had been asleep for many years, was not a warm sunlight, but a dazzling flash baptism. Even though I only collected artifacts all night, I wasn't in the name of excavating myself, but I am glad that I can calmly appreciate the many artifacts of Baekje's soul 1,500 years ago at the National Princess Museum.

   The National Princess Museum, which you can meet right after passing through Gongju Hanok Village, is the first place to visit before visiting the princess of the Ungjin era. The museum consists of the Royal Tomb of King Muryeong, the ancient culture room of Chungnam, and an outdoor exhibition hall. Among the 4,600 relics excavated in the Royal Tomb of King Muryeong, there are various authentic artifacts such as masonry and cemetery, gold and gold crown ornaments of the king and queen, earrings, dangling, and bracelets.

Among the seven tombs, King Muryeong and King Muryeong are sleeping. From the entrance to the tomb of the tomb, there are two tombs in front of it, the tomb of King Muryeong. During the Japanese colonial rule, a Japanese named Karube Zeon excavated the sixth tomb of King Muryeong. Fortunately, he did not consider the bonbon behind him as a royal tomb. Fortunately, his misjudgment prevented the robbery and looting of the tomb of King Muryeong. Thanks to that, I could feel the traces of Baekje 1,500 years ago.

   The Songsan Ligobun must first look around at the model exhibition hall. This is because you cannot actually see the interior of Songsan Rigogun. The royal tomb of King Muryeong also opened its interior, and a permanent decision was made in 1997 to protect the tomb. Inside the model building, there is an internal model of No. 6 where Muryeong Royal Mausoleum as well as Sasindo murals were found. If you look around the model building, take a look around the tomb. On the gentle uphill, the lower 3rd and upper 4th are gathered. When you stand at the observatory at the end of the tomb of Kofun, you can see the communist castle at a glance, and overlook the tumulus that rises soaking up Chaejuksan and Geumgang.

   Communist Castle meets accumulated history from Baekje to Joseon

  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    When you leave Songsan Rigogun, you will reach the communist castle through the stork rock sanctuary, Jemincheon, and the acid market. The communist castle was the royal castle of Baekje, which was enshrined in Woongjin. It was called Gongjusanseong Fortress in the Goryeo Dynasty and Ssangsusanseong Fortress in the Joseon Dynasty. Using the Geumgang as a natural moat, it was built as Saturn in the Baekje period, and now it is Seokseong built in the Joseon Dynasty.

  <div class="txt_p">
   As for the way to visit the communist castle, there are courses in Wanju, starting at Geumseoru, then going back to Geumseoru through Jinnamru, Gwangbokru, Manharu, and Gongbukru. There are also courses that come. Most of them use the latter a lot. After the selection fee of officials who went through the princesses of the Joseon Dynasty, such as judges, observers, and pastors, it is a golden rush. If you climb a short uphill in the counter-clockwise direction, you can meet the Estimated Royal Palace and Ssangsujeong. The slope of the rampant wall is curved with an S-shape, making it a beautiful landscape.

Cherry blossoms and fresh greens are bright in spring, and autumn leaves are beautiful in autumn. The large space in front of Ssangsujeong is the presumed royal palace of Baekje, and traces of buildings and ponds remain.

   Komanaru Myeongseung-gil is a 23km road that starts from Gomanaru and goes back to Gomanaru through Songsan-gobungun, Gongsanseong Fortress, and Yeonmisan Mountain, but it is not necessary to walk through the entire section. You can also rent a bicycle at the bicycle rental center located on the other side of the parking lot of the communist castle, and enjoy the Komanaru scenic spot by using a bicycle course from Communist Castle to Jeongancheon, Geumgangbyeon, and Gongjubo and returning to Komanaru. You can rent a bicycle for free through cell phone authentication, and you can ride up to 2 hours per time (Gongju Bicycle Call Center 041-856-1027).
