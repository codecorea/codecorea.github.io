   On the way to Gwanbangjerim, interesting questions and explanations from cultural commentators follow. "Do you know the name of this tree?" It is not easy to guess the name of a tree by looking at the leaves in the Gwanbang forest, where 300-year-old zelkova, hackberry, and peugeot trees flourish, but everyone is interested in trees. It is the sweetest foliage among the trees in the Gwanbangjerim that has the fastest foliage. After hearing the names of the trees standing along the Gwanbangjerim and knowing the features, the new ginseng tree looks familiar and savory. It is not difficult to walk in the dark thanks to the cultural tour commentators who shine a flashlight from the side and back in addition to the cultural tour commentator who walks ahead. If you walk slowly under the moonlight, you can hear the sound of whispering in the wind.

   After walking through Gwanbangjerim and walking through the bamboo forest of Juknokwon, you reach the summit of Seongbongbong. It is said that the adult peak of Juknokwon, the shortest circumference road in Korea, is made by turning three wheels. At that end, the participants walk around the path seriously. It is also serious to climb the adult peak and make a wish on the full moon of Hwiyoung-cheong. It is a precious time to think of a family that was longing for wishes and to convey a feeling of comfort to oneself tired of everyday life.

   When you come down to Juknokwon and arrive at Uiyangjeong, simple refreshments are served with tea leaves, rice cakes, and fruits.
