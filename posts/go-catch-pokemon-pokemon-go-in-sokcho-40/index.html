   In the summer of 2016, the Pokemon Go craze is not unusual. Pokemon Go is not yet officially released in Korea, but games are available in Sokcho, Gangwon-do and some surrounding areas. As this fact became known, Sokcho stood as 'Pokemon Holy Land'. Those who want to catch Pokemon flocked to Sokcho from all over the country. Sokcho buses were sold out, and a quick travel agency also offered travel packages to catch Pokemon. Let's take a look around playing Sokcho and Pokémon Go games that are screaming with the holiday season.

   Sokcho, located between Goseong and Yangyang, Gangwon-do, has mountains, lakes, and sea as well as geographical advantages within two hours from the metropolitan area. Why don't you take a more meticulous trip to Sokcho with this Pokemon hunting? If you don't forget to lift your head to the reality behind the phone, it will be a trip to Pokémon holding Pokemon and Sokcho. Be careful about safety accidents.

   Pokemon Go, are you?
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   In Pokemon Go, monsters appear in places where many people actually go. Since Pokemon is one of the most popular destinations, you need to know the local hotspots to meet many Pokemon. In the same vein, Sokcho's 11 most visited sites are the most popular tourist attractions of Sokcho. Among them are the Jangjang, where the bare-handed squid festival is in full swing.

  <div class="txt_p">
   I confess before I start catching a real monster. The reporter does not know the game. I've played Tetris games and have no interest in games or hobbies. The words augmented reality can only sound alien. I didn't understand why I was so enthusiastic that it was difficult to download the Pokemon Go app under the Korean account.

   Augmented Reality (AR) refers to a technology that displays computer-generated 3D graphics on a visible environment. In other words, if you run Pokemon Go, you will see the environment as if you were taking a picture, and monsters would appear on it. Then throw the monster ball to catch the Pokemon. Of course, it's not as easy as it sounds.

   Pokemon Go is a location-based game of Google Maps on your smartphone that requires monsters to enter a specific area. South Korea is missing here, but some survived and the Pokemon Go game was executed. That is Gangwon Sokcho and some surrounding areas. In addition to Sokcho, two other Pokemon Go viable areas, including Ulleung and Ulju-gun, Gyeongbuk are being discovered.

   For us, Abai Village, famous for filming the drama "Autumn Fairy Tales", is a collective settlement of displaced people. Originally it was a place where few people lived, but when refugees gathered during the Korean War, a village was formed. There are many specialty shops where you can taste the Sunbuk style. Abai Village (Cheongho-dong) and Jungang-dong are located in a quiet place. Sokcho Tourist Fish Market, famous for Chicken Gangjeong and Alley of Chicken, is also considered a Pokemon hot spot. When you go to the market, take a good look around, and remember the meeting center in the basement of the fish market.

    Throughout the wait for the cable car, people were busy catching Pokemon. I could not see the face of Mt. Sorak in the thick fog, but it was obvious that it was a different experience. Rumors that there is a Pokemon in Everest will not be rumored. Some even go out of the boat to catch rare Pokemon. In all cases, don't forget it's a safety first. Pokemon Go's completion is a safe return.

    Due to the Pokemon Go craze, Sokcho City began providing the integrated Pokemon Go online map on the City Hall website (www.sokcho.gangwon.kr) on July 26th. The integrated map, based on Google Maps, shows 8 locations of Sokcho tours, including the location of the `` Pocket Stop '' charging station, Pokemon training and combat space `` Pokemon Go Gymnasium '', and a free battery charging station. If you have a Pokemon Go hunting plan, you should check the benefits to the game users. If you catch 30 Pokémon by August 8, you can visit Sokcho City Museum for free.
