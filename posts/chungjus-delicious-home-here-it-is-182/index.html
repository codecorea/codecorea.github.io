   When I visited the movie restaurant opened in 1980 and wondered about the process of cooking, I readily agree. As soon as the three-person family ordered a set meal, they put a stone pot on the gas fire and put the soaked rice. Pour water over it and add 3 more beans. This is a common sight. When the rice water starts to boil, the aunt in charge of cooking the rice takes a small amount of the rice and adjusts the amount. It is said to be the only method of movie restaurant. Rice is purchased from Suanbo Agricultural Cooperatives. Soybeans are used in the summer in a mixture of three types: hedge beans, frost tae, juwolyangdae, and peas. It takes about 15 minutes for delicious rice to be completed. Immediately after cooking, the miso soup is served on another gas fire. When it boils, rice is finished.

   It's Haejanggukjip. In all cities, why was this restaurant selected as a “good rice house”? I'm curious about how to cook the rice after eating the ingredients of Haejangguk. Once rice is grown in the Chungbuk region, it is supplied from the Agricultural Cooperatives in Chungju. Add a little bit of millet to make the rice taste better. And use a pressure cooker with 12 servings. If you use a larger rice cooker, it will be difficult to maintain the proper taste. That is the secret of delicious rice.

   Haejangguk is cooked with yellow persimmon oil in perilla oil, and then cooks the broth for about 20 hours. Add boiled sprouts, eggs, and yellow beans to it, and add perilla powder. The soup is white and the taste is savory. Gangwon-do Hwangtae Haejangguk and Jeonju Bean Sprout Haejangguk are different flavors. Perilla oil and perilla powder met to create the flavor of Haejangguk, a unique restaurant. Seasoning with shrimp sauce and dipping green pepper in a side dish of kkakdugi makes it easier for the stomach to feel uncomfortable with a few drinks last night.

It uses rice produced in the Chungbuk region and cooks 20 servings of rice in a caster. When steaming, put a pot on top of the rice cooker lid to get the pressure cooker effect. The steaming time is about 30 minutes. Seasonal rice is mixed with chajo, millet, and black rice.

Cheonggukjang floats two or three times a week, and the amount is about two horses (14kg) at a time. Soybeans are also farmed and used by local residents. Since no imported beans are used, one bowl of Cheonggukjang is 8,000 won, which is 1,000 to 2,000 won more expensive than the other.
