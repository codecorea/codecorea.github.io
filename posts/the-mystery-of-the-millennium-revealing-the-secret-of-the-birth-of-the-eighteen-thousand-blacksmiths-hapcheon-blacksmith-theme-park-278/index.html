    The Tripitaka Koreana is considered as one of the greatest relics throughout Korea's history, or even Korea's history. Although there are about 20 species of blacksmith in the world, the eighteen thousand blacksmiths are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in June 2007 due to their high accuracy and completeness. What is so great about the eighteen thousand colonel? The place where you can see with your eyes, touch with your hands, and dig into the excellence of the blacksmith is the theme park.

    The Blacksmith Theme Park is, as its name suggests, the theme of the eighteen thousand blacksmiths. I know only that the country and the people suffering from the Mongol invasion were made to save by the power of the Buddha, but the deeper and more mysterious the world, the closer it is to the world of the Blacksmith.

   After passing through the theme park entrance and passing through the neatly formed square and park, you will reach Daejanggyeong Millennium Hall, the main exhibition space.

   Daejanggyeong Mystery Room shows all these processes in an easy-to-understand way. In addition, there is a space where you can find out about the eighteen thousand colonoscopes through numbers. For example, the total length of the eight thousand and eighteen thousand pieces is 8,1,258, and a single plate is 70 cm wide, 24 cm long, and 2.8 cm thick, stacked in a row, 508 m higher than Baekdusan. The translation work took a total of 36 years, the gross weight of the plate was about 280 tons, 108 pillars in the Jangyeong Panjeon, and 0 of the corroded plates in the large colon ... . It expresses the greatness of the blacksmith who was vaguely known in numbers, so it easily touches the skin.
