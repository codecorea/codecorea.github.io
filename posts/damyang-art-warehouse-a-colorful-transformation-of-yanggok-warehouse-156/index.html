   Is the transformation of the warehouse innocent? Namsong warehouse and bamboo product processing plant, which had been left for many years next to Gwanbangjerim in Damyang, were reborn as a space of culture and art in 2015. In the name of 'Dambit Art Warehouse'. It is located in the middle of Metasequoia Garosu-gil and Gwanbangjerim, making it a must-see destination for visitors to Damyang. In addition to the regularity of bamboo and metasequoia, let's take part in the fragrance of art.

   A different transformation of an old warehouse
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Before hearing the story of the birth of the Dambit Art Warehouse, let's look at a case where a grain storage warehouse in a rural area that lost its vitality has become a tourist attraction. First of all, Samrye Culture &amp; Arts Village in Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do is considered as a representative runner. Until 2010, there were several dongs in the Yanggok warehouse and houses built during the Japanese colonial period. As the rapid urbanization caused Samrye-eup to lose vitality day by day, the villagers sought to become a giant. The slogan that united their will into one is ‘Geun Ja-yeol Sang-rae (近 者 悅 遠 者 來)’. This means that people who live nearby should have fun, and people who are far away also come. Yes. If I don't like it, I can't help others. They have turned warehouses that no one is eyeing into places of culture and art.

   From 2011 to 2014, the residents of Samrye carried out the project of creating a Samrye Culture and Art Village with the motto of “Art is tourism”. Finally, large warehouses have been transformed into visual media art museum, book studio north art center, design museum, Kim Sang-lim woodwork, book museum, and cultural cafe. Samrye Culture &amp; Arts Village is widely known not only in Jeonbuk but also in Seoul and the metropolitan area, where visitors line up.

   The artists who participated in the exhibition of the Dambit Art Warehouse were 12 people including Lee Nam Lee, Byeongchan Lee, Daewon Jo, Sungyeon Joo, and Jung Unhak. Jinwol-ji of the Damyang-gun Cultural Foundation said, “I am a military unit without going to a large city such as Gwangju Metropolitan City.

   Step inside the exhibition room and slowly fall in love with the appreciation of the work. Although the Dambit Art Warehouse is less than the size of the Yangpyeong County Museum of Art, compared to the military unit art museum, it has the confidence that its life will last, as it has its own garden, such as literary cafes, sculpture parks, and giant trees of Gwanbangjerim.

   Enjoy bamboo pipe organ performance while drinking tea leaves
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The impressions received while appreciating the works of the complex are continued in the literary cafe. The bamboo pipe organ performance was in progress. Pipe organs are very expensive and large, so they are often installed in cathedrals and churches. The performance starts every week on Tuesday / Thursday at 2 o'clock and on the weekend / holiday at 3 o'clock, each lasting 30 minutes. The taste of having a cup of tea leaves and watching a bamboo pipe organ while reading a book is a happiness that cannot be enjoyed without a trip to Damyang. The spacious space has a high ceiling, so the organ sound is magnificent. As much as the playing time, even the chatter of adults and the shuffling of children are cut off.

   Watching the bamboo pipe organ performance felt only briefly, and curiously laughed from corner to corner, I found a blackboard hidden under a staircase going up to the second floor. When I look at the chart drawn under the heading of 'Government Grain Storage Status', I realize that this was the Yanggok warehouse. How many people have actually seen a thermometer, moisture meter, etc. in the list of management equipment written on the board? The cafe sells Americano, Green Tea Latte, Juice, Smoothie, Aid, Sandwich, Cookie, Cake, etc. in addition to the tea leaves and tea leaves.

   Sculpture garden and Gwanbangjerim are spread behind the literary cafe. It has a large through-glass window, so it has an excellent open feeling. If you leave the book you read in place and go out as a sponsor, a scary-looking tiger statue greets you. I put a long tail on my back, but the tip of the tail is a pine shape, so I have to look into the description of the work. It is a story called ‘The Story of the Tiger and the Turtle’. “It was based on the story that a tiger can settle for a thousand years by holding its tail. As I read the passage, “I express the feeling of the pine tree in the tail part,” the question raises my head asking, “Is Damyang the part of the tiger's tail?”
