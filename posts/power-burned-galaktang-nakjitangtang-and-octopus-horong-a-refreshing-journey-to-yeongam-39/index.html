   Tribal Octopus, a gift of abundant southern island tidal flats
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Yeongam-gun, with its rich tidal flats in Namdo, was famous for its tribal octopus. If you look at the map for a while, Yeongam is located along the west coast of East Sea, which leads to Mokpo along Hampyeong and Muan, which are also famous for their tribal octopus. It is no wonder that the three-headed octopus became famous in Yeongam Land, where salty and fresh waters of the west coast were mixed along the stem of Yeongsan River in Namdo. The Yeongsan River Hagotduk construction has now lost its reputation as a mountain producing tribal octopus. This is because one day, octopus paradise was created by the development of various octopus recipes.

   Tribal octopus with eight thin legs, what taste?

   Before tasting the octopus, let's take a look at the identity of the three-foot octopus. What is a tribal octopus? When I was young, I thought 'three foot octopus' was a three foot octopus. Even though I sometimes watched a whole tribal octopus on TV, there was no doubt that his feet would be "three". Faith continued until we realized that the tax in the three-foot octopus was not a tax, but a tax.

   Tribal octopus, commonly called 뻘 octopus, is small but tender and has a taste of taste. Whole or cooked octopus can be tasted by rolling it on wooden chopsticks. Of course, you must chew on the octopus, which tells you that it is still alive in your mouth.

   Fresh sesame oil added to sesame oil is delicious, but the tribal octopus recipes are varied. Let's break it down into raw and cooked food. Depending on your taste, it may be a little different, but your first hand is to taste live octopus. Sweet and chewy texture is alive. It's small and soft, so it's easy to eat raw. In addition to the octopus Tangtang (an octopus cut out to be easy to eat), some of the octopus specialty stores in Dokcheon come out with a full-bodied tribal octopus.

   The curiosity was released from the name of Dokcheon Village. This is because Dokcheon Village came out of the “Calf Poison”. Dokcheon Village was a village that raises good cattle. Thanks to this, the octopus shops sold their ribs. Then, as the price of cows plummeted, they cooked “Gallak-tang,” which is filled with octopus, and the taste was amazing. The ribs and octopus will meet, the meat will be softer and the soup will be cooler. In addition, the two foods representing the land and the sea met, so did not fall into the food. The sea and land meets Galumnaktang, which is based on its taste and nutrients.
