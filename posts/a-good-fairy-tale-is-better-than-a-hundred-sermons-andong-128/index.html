It's a fairy tale telling us that a bunch of tiny dog poops are useful, and that anything in the world is worth living.

   The teacher was born in Japan in 1937. I was the sixth of five sons and two daughters between my father and my poor mother who were taken to labor. After returning to World War II in Japan, he went through the Korean War and felt the misery of the war. Poverty and war lead families to break up, eat and not be treated properly, and suffer from systemic tuberculosis. Young Kwon, Jung-saeng, who was unjust to die, wanted to leave a good book.

   The dog-dung, which endured a painful body, was elected to the Children's Literature Awards and continued to write with the meaning of life. Nevertheless, he never suffered a health recovery and suffered from illness all the time. In addition to The Puppy, the novel Mongsil Sister, whose main character was Mong Mong-yi, who suffered poverty and war and did not lose humanity, was also loved by many. In addition, there were 『Rangrang Star Geelongrong』 published as a book only after being written in the monthly magazine until the beginning of his death. He has made numerous works such as Flower Garden of Badger's House, Uncle Bear and Opundol, and Hantijae Sky.

   After the teacher passed away in 2007, he was amazed at how to organize his belongings. It is because the balance of the account book left by the teacher has reached 1 billion won. The less people eat, the less they wear, the less they use their lives, the people in the neighborhood thought they were just poor writers. What he cherished and cherished for himself was to feed the poor and naked children of the world and to read. So he asked that the legacy and future taxes be used for children in North Korea, Africa and the Middle East. "All the books I have written are mostly bought and read by the children, so the incentives from them should be returned to the children."

    10 minutes by car from the fairy tale country is the house where Mr. Kwon Jung-seng lived and a lifelong church where he was a servant. It was in 1968 that he, ill without a family, entered the church doorway. Every day, she pulled the strings, rang the bells, helped with church work, and wrote at night. In the same year, he wrote &lt;Doggy Dog Dung&gt; and he was not satisfied with it. It is cold in winter and sultry doorway in summer, but the teacher wrote many works here. The doorway and bell tower where the teacher stayed changed slightly over the years, but it is enough to bring back the feeling.

   There is a house where the teacher lived under Bilbae Mountain, which is seen from the church. It is a small clay house with no trees, no fences, no names, and a backside of Bilbangi Hill, with two trees. There is a room in the clay house, a kitchen, a toilet and a kennel in the corner of the yard. This small house, about 26 square meters (8 pyeong), was built by a local young man for his teacher, where he lived from 1983 until his death. “It's nice to be warm, quiet, lonely at will, sick, and thought-prone,” he wrote to Lee. Although the roof is curled up in the remotest part of town, it was a perfect place for a teacher who said, "The artist must be lonely."
