   Do I try MTB too?

  <div class="txt_p">
   Confession, there was a time when I was looking for a ski resort to learn skiing. But one day I realized Not everyone can love skiing and snowboarding. Especially if you're as cold as you are. Unfortunately, it wasn't until summer that I was able to walk back to the ski slopes. One hot summer, at Daegwallyeong Yongpyong Resort, I faced the cool and lush landscape and wind.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   As the heat started early this year, he led his family to Daegwallyeong. Daegwallyeong is much cooler than other areas, and there are plenty of things to do, including exotic ranches and large resorts. So it's perfect for a cool and exciting summer day.
   <br/>
   We go to Yongpyong Resort for a walk and enjoy sports. Summer ski resorts have a different color and atmosphere than winter. The white-white landscape hides its traces and the surroundings are 'green'.

   The first thing you noticed at Yongpyong Resort is the MTB riders who race through the green. A group of riders ride their bikes downhill and jump from a slightly protruding chin. At the moment, the bicycle disintegrates and descends. It's short, but it makes a strong impression as if you were dealing with a slow motion effect. Watching riders jump from young children to adults.

   Suddenly, it reminded me of the scenery I saw in Whistler, Canada many years ago. It was a fresh shock when many riders raced down the MTB at Whistler Ski Resort, which was standing on the summer road. Riding the bicycle while the wind was cool and exciting. Let's learn MTB to Koreans outside Korea. To challenge spirit. Of course, it's been a while since then.

   A few years later, he faced an MTB riding scene at Yongpyong Resort. In the meantime, there has been a bicycle boom in Korea and many MTB users. At the same time, two MTB parks, which consisted of naturally mountain bike trails, began to emerge. Yongpyong Resort MTB Park opened in 2015. People come from various groups, including clubs, family and friends. Adult men and women as well as teenagers use the MTB park.

   I went to the MTB center and riders gathered on the deck for a while. There are men in their 40s and 50s who came from the club, and middle school students who came to the MTB park for the first time and high school students who came with friends. Foreigners who have taken a plane to experience Yongpyong Resort MTB Park are also eye-catching. They come from Ireland and Thailand and have been riding the MTB here for three days and the course is quite attractive.

   'I want to ride once MTB' comes up again. Is it possible to use Yongpyong Resort MTB Park even for beginners without equipment preparation? Of course. There is a separate course for beginners at MTB Park, and rental bicycles and protective gear. MTB Park staff will also accompany the participants several times to guide the course. If you feel that you are familiar with the course, you can enjoy riding alone.

   Mountain coasters ride on sleds and slide down rails. Yongpyong Resort Mountain Coaster has a total length of 1300m and a maximum speed of 40km. The feeling of speed with bare body is quite fast. The operation method is easy. Speed up and slow down with one lever. Young children can also be used with their parents. Feeling like you're sliding down a green mountain foot is the `` let '' itself!

   Segway was developed in 2001 by an American inventor named Dean Carmen. One person stands and rides on the balance of the body. The sensor measures the occupant's center of gravity movement in hundredths of a second, balancing it against falling. It can be used from the 3rd grade of elementary school and from 20kg or more

   Listen to the guide and learn the basics. There is no device like a brake at all. Only body balance moves. Anyone can enjoy the basic motions such as forward, stop, and rotate. It consists of a course where you learn the basics and take a look around with your guide. The general experience lasts about 20 minutes and the mountain experience using the mountain segway takes about 30 minutes.

    Her 40-year-old husband and 10-year-old daughter raise their thumbs after riding the Segway. It's very fun. Well… . The downside of Segway is aftereffects. My husband wants to buy a Segway, and her daughter searches for the internet and asks her to go to Yongpyong Resort for a Segway ride. You may have to endure this aftereffect.
