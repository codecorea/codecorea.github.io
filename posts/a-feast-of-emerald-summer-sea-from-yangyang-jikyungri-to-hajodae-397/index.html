    When exiting Namyangyang IC of Donghae Expressway, it is Yangyang in the north and Gangneung in the south, bordering Hyangho, the lagoon. Departing from Jigyeong-ri Beach, heading north on National Highway 7, you will see the Yangyang Beach and the beautiful harbor, where the blue sea overflows. Let's enjoy the sea of Yangyang from Jikyungri beach to Hajodae this summer.

   The sea of Yangyang that meets Namyangyang IC of the Donghae Expressway is the beach of Jikyung-ri. Jikyung-ri, where Jikyung-ri Beach is located, is a town named because it is on the border between Gangneung and Yangyang. The fence is installed, so the view is not very good, but it has a dense pine forest and over 1.5km of beach.

   To the north of Jikyung-ri Beach, Wonpo Beach continues along the border of Sanghwacheon. After crossing the 1st bridge, there is a small rock called “Sangam”. The story about burn cancer is interesting. Three companions are fishing in Sangcheon, and only poisonous companions have produced the fish. As No-seung passed by and prayed in prayer, considering that he was particularly careful, he disappeared and a rock appeared. It is said that the rock is called burn cancer because it is like a burn that refers to a monk who has practiced for a long time. Wonpo Beach, which spreads north from Sanghwacheon, is just as long as Jikyung-ri Beach and the pine forest is lush, making it ideal for camping.

   Along with Samcheok Chogok Port and Gangneung Simgok Port, Namae Port, known as Gangwon-do's three most beautiful ports, boasts a beautiful scenery like the nickname “Venice of Gangwon-do”. In particular, there is a song that reminds me of Namae Port. This is Song Chang-shik's &lt;Whale Hunting&gt;, which starts with "Drinking, singing and dancing, but there is only one sorrow in my heart." Namae Port is well known as the location of the movie Whale Hunting. It was filmed in 1984, and even though it has already been over 30 years, its reputation does not seem to have cooled.

Originally, this peak was an uninhabited island called Yanga-do, but it became a small mountain on land by creating a breakwater. Yanga also has a promenade to the summit, and the town's Seonghwangdang and Jeongja are located.

When you climb the Yeonhwadae, the marvelous rocks created by waves of many years, such as the tortoise rock and the fist rock, resembling a tortoise rock and toes and fists, spread over the sea. Looks up The group of yellowfish in the sea around Yeonhwadae is also worth seeing. The yellowfish is a fish of the carp family Ingot, born in a river, going out to the sea to live, and going back to the river where it is home. People can be bored to see the food being thrown, and the yellow fishes cause a splash of water so that the water is black. It is a scenery that can be seen from June to December. Suddenly, these yellow fish and the mother's head are worried that they will not lose their own habits like seagulls.

   If you go up north again from Hugheam, you will encounter Pope Beach and Jukdo Beach in turn. Between the two beaches is a small island called Jukdo. Like Yangado in Namae Port, it used to be an island and now land. There is a lush bamboo forest, so it was named Jukdo. Now, pine trees are densely packed so as not to allow a handful of light instead of bamboo. The promenade through the pine forest blends with the rocky cliffs, providing a landscape comparable to the sea.

   The 38th Line Rest Area is a rest area that looks like a rest area along National Route 7 adjacent to the sea. A small island called Jodo and a knight questionnaire with a small mushroom-shaped lighthouse decorate the seascape. The 38th Line Resting Place was where the 38th Line was drawn before the Korean War broke out. It was a land of North Korea bordering the 38th parallel and became a fierce battlefield when the Korean War broke out. When the ceasefire reached the end of the ceasefire, the ROK armed forces advanced through Sokcho to Goseong.

   After passing the 38th line rest area, Hajodae is a great place. It is one of the most beautiful sights in Yangyang. Hajodae is the name after each of the names of Harun and Jo Joon, the nation's national officials. It is said to have been built during the end of the Joseon Dynasty. However, there is no change as much as the scenery viewed from Hajodae, so people's elasticity never stops. Hajodae's rock formations are literally spectacular. Pine trees hanging from the branches surround the Hajodae, and the east sea is spread across the pine trees.
