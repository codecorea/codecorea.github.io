   To catch the end of the fall, he buryed the dead warriors to bury the last season.

   This fall, which has been bitten, goes to Buyeo in a month because the leaves are falling early. Fortunately, martial arts haven't completely dropped the fall yet. There's still a lot of energy last summer. Passing through the ticket office is one order soon. On the forehead of one order, there is a large board called 'Mansusan Muralosa'. It is a harmonious combination of 'unquantity', meaning immeasurable, and the name of the mountain, 'Mansu,' which means enjoying a long life. Muryangsa Temple is a millennial temple that was founded during King Munseong King (Unification 839 ~ 857). However, like most temples and architectural cultural assets in Korea, all martial arts disappeared during the Imjin War, but were rebuilt in 1623 (Art. 1) to reach today.

   Passing through a small valley and reaching the Cheonwangmun gate, a handsome party holder welcomes visitors to the right. The party holding means an elongated pole that hung the flag of the temple, or a holding seat that supported the party from left to right. This is a sign that the grounds of the temple begin here.

   Ascending to the Cheonwangmun Gate, the paradise of Muyongsa Temple, the Five-storied Pagoda, and beyond are in the square frame of Cheonwangmun. Too stable angle. Even if you don't specialize in photography, you can naturally lift the camera. But the designer who designed this stunning view did not expose 100% of the paradise, the heart of the temple. The paradise roof was slightly covered with pine and zelkova branches. I sat and stood trying to take a picture to avoid the branches. 1 minute left? Ah! Realize that it was a wonderful piece of coriander to cover the Buddha's dwelling place. Wouldn't that branch have been cool to see through the paradise? Rather, the tree branches add to the secret paradise of paradise.

   Slowly approach to paradise. When you reach the pine tree that covered the roof, you can see the stone lanterns, the five-storied pagoda, and the paradise. The stone lanterns, five-storied pagoda, and paradise of Muryuksa are all national treasures. It may seem as if it is a cultural asset, but the history of the cultural assets filled with signs and the knowledge of art history do not seem to help this autumn. So I don't deliberately go in detail. The dust of knowledge in my head seems to sit on the surface of the sticky emotion. Just look at the three treasures at a distance. From a large perspective, the gaze that originated from the ground raises a sense of ascension through the stone lanterns and the top of the pagoda, leading to the paradise ridge. In addition, five hundred and one thousand years of history, without serious damage and damage, adds dignity.

   Watch the paradise round from left to right. The boats of the pillars supporting the eccentric structure of the paradise are extraordinarily bulging. It is a commonly called shedding column. The exterior looks like two floors, but the inside of the paradise is a layered structure with no layers. It can be seen that this structure is not for the actual use of the second floor, but for the formality and dignity of the building.

   Turn around the paradise backyard and stand under the maple tree in front of the fence on the right side of the building. It's good luck to come to the last martial arts afternoon. The sun has started to head west of Mansusan, and the warm autumn afternoon sun plentifully covers the grounds. Under the maple tree, the backlight is covered with maple leaves and the shutter is released. It's not wrong to say 'take photos with your feet'. As soon as the monk passes by.

   Kim Si-sook, a poor genius writer or owner of a free soul
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   There is one person you must meet in Muryangsa Temple. Kim Si-seon (1435 ~ 1493) is a monthly leader who is always introduced with nicknames such as Pung Un Ah, genius author, and Shin Dong. Pass the paradise and cross the small stream to the left to see the portrait of Kim Si-seop in Yeongjeonggak. Kim Si-sook did not recognize the seizure of the throne and lived as a monk and wife forever. He left the world at age 21 and wandered all over the country.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Let's take a look at the portrait of Kim Jung-shik. Yeongjung differs from the intense primary color discord commonly found in verses. It is also different from the portrait of the Joseon Squadron who dressed nicely in Gwanbok. Kim Si-seop in Yeongjung's hands are kept neatly in the sleeve, but he is frowning with frowns. That is why many critics say that they have captured the features of dissatisfied intellectuals who are dissatisfied with the world. You can see that. At twenty-one years of age, when King Sejo came to the throne, he burned all the books he had read and left the world and became a monk. However, Kim's life is not filled with bad luck, hoarding and criticism of society.
   <br/>
   He left the world and toured Kanto and Hunan, enjoying scenery and writing poems. In his thirties, he spent six years in Gyeongju Geumosan, the current Gyeongju Namsan, dedicated to his work. The result of the immersion is Kum-O Myth, which is regarded as Korea's first Chinese novel. Was Kim Si-sook a poor genius who met the times wrongly? Or was he the owner of a free soul? Eventually, he sees his wandering as an alienation from power and mainstream or a will of free life. I give a small hint to that not easy problem. Kim Si-seop writes the motive of wandering in the preface of `` Every Month House ''
