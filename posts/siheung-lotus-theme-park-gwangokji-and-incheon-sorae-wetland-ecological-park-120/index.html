   Kang Hee-min, a Korean who bloomed lotuses
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    In the 9th year of Joseon Dynasty (1463), Kang Hee-myung, a deputy director of the Korean Central Court, brings lotus seeds from Nanjing Hall. Arriving in Joseon, Kang Hee-min planted seeds in a pond in Siheung, Gyeonggi-do. And the kite blossoms.
    <br/>
    Kang Hee-min was in office in Sejong 29 (1447), paying at the door and star hour. Among those who passed along with him at the time was Seongsammun (emergency paid to literature). He was well known as a prominent connoisseur, including participating in compilations such as GyeongGuk Daejeon, Dongmunseon, Dongguk Yeoji Seungram, and the rites of National Jockey, but he was also an agronomist who wrote a farm book such as Geumyang Miscellaneous. Therefore, lotus blossomed with interest and affection for farming.
    <br/>
    Gwanok-ji was so known as a lotus pond, but in fact, there was a lotus in Joseon before that. The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty The Taejong Annals show that in 1411, Taejong served the king and drank alcohol at the Gwangyeonru in Changdeokgung Palace.

    A lotus blooms in a small pond of Gwanokji, giving off its fragrant aroma. The lotus of Gwanokji is white with the tip of pale pink. Along with the beautiful shape of the lotus flower, you will also feel the heart of a man who planted seeds more than 500 years ago. Gwanokji is the 8th ruins of Siheung-si, Gyeonggi-do.

   Sorae Wetland Ecological Park was originally a Sorae Salt Farm. Sorae Salt Farm was produced in the mid 1930s and began producing salt. This salt was transported to Soonpo-gu by Incheon Expressway by narrow-line train or ship. These salts were then used as munitions for gunpowder. Sorae Salt Farm was closed in 1996 and was reborn as Sorae Wetland Ecological Park in 2009.

   The reason why the tidal flats are all red is because of salt plants such as seven noodles. Among the salt plants growing in the salty ground, reddish color is the seventh and the red seaweed, and Sorae mud flats are particularly rich. Salt plants are the primary producers of coastal wetlands that feed animals and cleanse contaminants.
