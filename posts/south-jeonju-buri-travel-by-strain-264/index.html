   Namdo S Line, S-Train
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   S-Train, the South Island's marine tourism train, began operating in September 2013 as a tourist train through Namdo. Currently, it runs from Busan to Masan, Jinju, Hadong, Suncheon, etc. to Yeosu Exopo Station, and from Seodaejeon to Jeonju, Suncheon, Beolgyo, Boseong, etc. to Gwangju Songjeong Station. Each of the two routes runs, but transfers from Suncheon can take you from Busan to Gwangju Songjeong.

   Gwangju has Sangmaek! Gwangju Lettuce Fried
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Take the S-train to Gwangju first. Gwangju's representative snack is fried lettuce. It is easy to think that it is fried in oil by frying lettuce like fried sesame leaves or fried peppers, but fried lettuce refers to eating various kinds of tempura in lettuce. Place the tempura on the lettuce as if eating meat, and then sprinkle the spicy soy sauce with cheonyang pepper and onion into the tempura like miso. Cheongyang pepper and onion are added, so the unique feeling of tempura goes away, and it has a surprisingly light and refreshing taste. The crisp taste of the lettuce and the crispness of the tempura adds to the crisp taste.

   If you have Chimaek (chicken &amp; beer) in Seoul, there is Sangmaek (fried lettuce &amp; beer) in Gwangju. Beer can be served with a simple yogi at an affordable price of less than 10,000 won. 'Hyunwandangyeom' located in Chipyeong-dong, Sangmu district of Gwangju is proud of crispy fried lettuce. There is also a famous lettuce tempura restaurant in Gwangju Mudeung Market. If you are longing for the emotions of traditional markets, 'Fried Nara' in Mudeung Market is fine. The tempura with gardenia is coated and the yellow-colored tempura is delicious.

   Suncheon Hwawoldang, a glutinous rice cake that continues the third generation
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Hwawoldang, an old bakery with 90 years of history, is located in Jungang-ro, a downtown area of Suncheon. This place, which is followed by the modifier of Korea's first bakery, has been passed down to three generations, from grandfathers to fathers and sons.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Hwawoldang sells only two types of bread. One is Volcaster and the other is glutinous rice cake. The order of Volcastella, which became the specialty of Hwawoldang, is so pushed that other breads cannot be made at all. Although there are several types of confectionery such as manju and cookies that have been sold since the Japanese colonial period, they are only an assortment but not a flagship product.

   Volkastera for 1,500 won and glutinous rice cake for 1,000 won are snacks loved by travelers who are always curious about their mouths. The yellow Volcastella's soft castella was filled with red beans. The red beans are filling the inside, so it seems very sweet, but not as sweet as you might think. It's sweet, but depending on the taste of the person, it's a bit different, but it's enough to eat as a dessert or when you go out. Young children who have not yet had teeth or elderly people with uncomfortable gums may like it. The soft taste of castella is comfortable in the mouth and gives a fragrant aroma. It is so popular that there are many times when bread falls out at 3-4 pm.

   Dolsan Got Kimchi's reputation in bread
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Whatever comes to mind immediately after Yeosu is Dolsan Gat Kimchi. It may be a prejudice that you can only taste Dolsangat with kimchi. In Yeosu, there are freshly made bread and freshly made pie with 15% freshness. It is said that the functional word can be used when a certain ingredient is contained in more than 15%.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   How did you put the freshly spicy gourd on the bread and pie? The reason why it tastes spicy is because of the toxicity of the sulfur components in it. In general, kimchi seasoning acts to decompose sulfur, so fresh kimchi can be eaten deliciously, but it is said to be difficult to make with other foods. The owner of the freshly baked bakery studied five years to make fresh bread, and eventually developed a recipe for making bread with an enzyme that breaks down the sulfur component.

   There are six functional breads made in Yeosu Gatbaun. These include Goyota made with windproof leaves and Cheonnyeoncho jam, Gotdon bread with Gat, Dolsan Gatpie, Gatti cookie, and Cheonnyeoncho picel made with Cheonnyeoncho. Add enough freshly made to make a functional bread, but the taste of freshly made, which may be burdensome, is hardly tasted. Fresh bread is a healthy bread. Usually, after eating wheat food or bread, the stomach becomes bloated or sour, but there are no gluten side effects.

   Steamed bread overflowing with fermented red beans and pearl restoration bakery
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   For more than 100 years, there is a restorative bakery even inside the Jinju Central Market where nearby agricultural and marine products are gathered. The menu of Subok Bakery is simple. Steamed bread, sweet red bean porridge, and red bean shaved ice are all snacks where red beans are the main ingredients. Because of its sweet smell and strong visuals that make the saliva build up, Subok steamed bread is famous not only in pearls but also in the outside world.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Subok steamed bread is a little different from any steamed bread. The red beans of the fine texture with flowing luster are not only contained in the bread, but flow through the whole body of the steamed bread. If you put a lot of red beans in your mouth and put it in your mouth, you will get an exclamation point saying "Oh, this is the taste!" It's a tacky but sweet taste that I used to eat as a child. It is sweet, but does not get tired. You can expect that the inside will be empty because there is a lot of red bean paste on the outside, but there is also red bean inside. It looks like it's so sweet because it has a lot of red beans inside and outside, but it's not. The red bean taste of the memories pulls the taste. The bread is also not chewy and chewy. Six breads like a child's fist cost 3,000 won per serving.

   In Korea, farmland uses only domestic red beans, and the owner picks red beans every day. Domestic red beans are two to three times more expensive than imported ones. So insisting on domestic production is not as easy as it sounds, but I still use only Korean red beans. The bakery is a livelihood for the owner and the couple, but it is not a business that only tries to make money. Memories, longings, and hungry pears are filled with steamed bread. A small bakery with 5 tables is always a door-to-door. It is also a placenta where customers line up, but at 12 o'clock, the door is closed when the bread made that day is sold out.
