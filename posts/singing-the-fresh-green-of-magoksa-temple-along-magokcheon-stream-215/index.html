   After passing the busy shopping street at the entrance to Magoksa Temple, Magokcheon Stream runs side by side and leads you to Magoksa Temple. When Magokcheon winds up one round like a Taegeuk pattern, it reaches the grounds of Magoksa Temple. Magoksa Temple is a millennium study founded by Jajangyulsa during King Munmu of Silla. It has been said that a lot of horses grew up in the valley of Taehwasan, where Magoksa Temple was inhabited.

   Magoksa Temple is a temple with a long history, so you can't look around at any one. There are Yeongsanjeon, Daeungbojeon, Daegwangbojeon, and Five-storied Pagoda designated as treasures in the precincts, and Haetalmun, Cheonwangmun, Myeongbujeon, National History Hall, Eungjinjeon, Simgeumdang, and Gobang are designated as cultural properties.

   Among them, Daekwang Preservation is one of many places to see and it is good to take a slow tour. First, the plaque of Daekwangbojeon, which shows brilliant technique, is known as the writing of Pyoam Kang Se-hwang. Kang Se-hwang is well-known as a representative of the late Joseon Dynasty, and an instructor of Hong-do Kim. Inside the Daekwangbojeon Hall, you can meet the Virozana Buddha, which sits toward the east rather than the south, such as the Museoksujeon in Buseoksa in Yeongju or Daeungjeon in Yeonggwangbulgapsa. Behind the post-war paintings, there is the Suwol Baekwan Gwaneumdo in white clothes. In addition, there are 16 Nahan and Sichuan kings as well as various landscape paintings inside and outside Daekwang Preservation. This is because Magoksa has many masters who draw paintings in the center of the southern pixel, the great veins of Buddhist art.

   In Daekwangbojeon, there is also a story of a nest made of oak bark. It is a story that a person with a disease of the sick had a place for 100 days in order to offer to the Buddha, and walked leisurely after taking the place on the 100th day. It is a story that the Buddha impressed with his sincerity and showed his grace.

   The writings of the Joseon Dynasty also remain. That's the signboard of Yeongsanjeon at the entrance of Magoksa Temple. When King Sejo visited Magoksa Temple to see Kim Si-pup, who is one of the incarnations, and he couldn't meet, he left the plaque of Yeongsanjeon and his kiln. When King Sejo seized the throne, it was Kim Si-seop, a monthly fan who cried while burning books. Sejo's regrettable desire to meet and meet him is buried. As Yeongsanjeon is currently being dismantled, it is impossible to see the plate, and it is difficult to see Sejo's kiln.

   Magoksa Temple stands at the top of Daekwangbojeon and shows a very unique arrangement. When you go up the stairs behind Daekwangbojeon, there is a huge Daeungbobojeon standing like a 2nd floor pavilion. Looking down the grounds from the stairs, the roof line of the building is very beautiful in the direction of Simgeumdang and Gobang.

   Magoksa Temple also retains the traces of Baekbeom Kim Gu. Kim Gu escaped from prison while he was serving as a murderer for the murder of a Japanese army lieutenant who misunderstood Empress Myeongseong. In 1946, shortly after liberation, the teacher visited Magoksa Temple and planted juniper trees on the grounds. At that time, a planted juniper tree stands for 60 years, standing beside Eungjinjeon.

  <div class="txt_p">
   At the foot of Mt. It is aka “Baekbeom Meditation Road”. This is the path that Kim Gu walked while hiding in Magoksa Temple. Magoksa Solbaram-gil consists of three courses. Course 1 is a 3km course that departs from Magoksa Temple and returns to Magoksa Temple after passing through Kim Saekbalteo and Gunwangdae. Course 2 is a meditation walkway starting from the parking lot of Magoksa Temple and going down to Magoksa Temple through natural pine bath, Baengnyeonam, Hwainbong, and Saenggol Village. It is 10km from Bong, Traditional Buddhist Cultural Center, and Gunwangdae to Magoksa Temple. It is a place where people of all ages, men and women can come and go, and can see the impressive pine forest path and traces of Baekbeom Kim Gu.

   Course 1 starts with a tour of the Magoksa temple grounds and a tour of the juniper trees planted by Kim Gu. If you pass by the side road of the juniper tree, you will wind up around Magoksa and meet the flowing Magokcheon. Along the road that runs alongside Magokcheon, there is a Baekbeom Kim Gu teacher Shakbalteo. It is said that the teacher was imprisoned for the murder of the Japanese army and escaped from Magoksa-ro and became a monk.

   “The priest Ho Deok-sam brought a knife to cut his hair. I went out to the stream and crushed the shaved mantra, and my coat fell on the sand. I have already made up my mind, but tears fell like my hair. ” At that time, the record remains in the Baekbeom Ilchi. The fresh green along the waterside of Magokcheon is beautiful. It seems that the first spring came with the bite of Magokcheon.

   Leaving Kim's shackle ground and crossing Baekbeom Bridge, the road leads straight to the mountain. The entrance is rather flat. The winter is still dim, and the pine trees have fallen all over the place due to the typhoon that hit last year.
