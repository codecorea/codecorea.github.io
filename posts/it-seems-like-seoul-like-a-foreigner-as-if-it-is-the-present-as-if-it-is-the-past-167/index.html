    From the bustling street of Itaewon, you can take a brief walk through the Itaewon 119 Safety Center to the hidden spot in Itaewon, the way to Usadan-gil. The road is divided in front of Bogwang Elementary School, but as you go up the 10th road to the left Usadan-ro, the full-scale Usadan-gil tour begins. The entrance to Usadan-gil has an exotic atmosphere, with restaurants in Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon, and India, signboards written in Arabic, and strangers wearing hijab and turban. The Islamic Mosque of the Republic of Korea, the first Islamic member in Korea that opened in 1976, peaks in exotic mood.

    Since there is support for Islam, there are many halal food stores around. Halal food refers to food permitted to Muslims. Because it goes through strict standards according to Islamic law, it is an atmosphere that has recently been recognized as a health food, leaving religious colors. You don't have to be familiar with halal food. There is also a restaurant specializing in Halal certification on Usadan-gil. 'Eid' and 'Macan' are typical. We serve foods familiar to us, such as grilled fish, bulgogi, and bibimbap. It is the same as regular Korean food, except that it uses halal-certified ingredients. Many Muslims who want to taste Korean food come to Korea during their travels.

    If you want to taste exotic halal food, there are many choices. You can also enjoy kebabs, Indian foods, which are quite popular in Korea, and Pakistani, Egyptian, and Turkish foods that are still a bit unfamiliar. 'Pak India Restaurant' is a Pakistani food specialty store. Although the word Pakistani food is unfamiliar, the main menu is similar to Indian foods such as Tandoori Chicken, Curry, and Nan, and it is surprisingly familiar.

    'Cerban Café' is also recommended. When you enter the store, first of all, the interior reminiscent of Turkey catches the eye. Decorated with ornaments and tiles from Turkey. Here, you can enjoy sweet Turkish desserts, tea and panini kebab. If you don't know what to eat, order from Baklava. Baklava is a sweet pastry with nuts, and is the representative dessert of Turkey. There are various types of original, pistachio and chocolate, and it goes well with Turkish coffee or tea. Other Turkish desserts, bread, cookies and ice cream are also available.

    Another attraction of Usadan-gil is that it retains the nostalgic Korean emotion and atmosphere. This area is a residential area where old houses and alleys are closely connected, and was designated as a redevelopment area in 2003. Since rent is relatively cheap compared to the surrounding area, young artists and young entrepreneurs entered the Usadan-gil since the early 2010s, creating a space full of personality. That's how Usadan Road is now.

    Many shops and workshops entered and disappeared repeatedly, and they also suffered from upset. Still, there are shops that keep this place. Champ Coffee and Otto are typical. 'Champ Coffee', an early member of Usadan-gil, has a nice appearance. It looks like an old rice house or a hole shop. This is a space where people in the neighborhood seemed to have stopped by. Champ Coffee actually acts as a love room for Usadan-gil. The largest table is a place where the owner works, and a seat where anyone can sit. When you sit here, you are a regular or wanderer. Various stories come and go in front of a cup of coffee. I don't know how to pass the time thanks to a good host, such as the background of the birth of a champa coffee, the way to drink the champa coffee, and how to drink it.

    ‘OTTO’ near Champ Coffee is a kimbap restaurant introduced in TV programs 〈Master of Life〉 and American daily 〈New York Times〉. Wasabi kimbap, which contains romaine and wasabi sauce, is famous for its shape and taste. It is a taste that will be enjoyed not only by Koreans but also by foreigners, so visitors from various countries visit it. The outdoor terrace is as attractive as Gimbab. On a sunny day, sit on a small terrace overlooking Usadan-gil and try eating gimbap. It gives the taste and taste that will remain with life gimbap.

    The highlight of Usadan-gil is hidden in 'Um Record' on the side of Dokkaebi Market. A sound record that easily and conveniently touches the vinyl (LP) culture, you can enjoy music with LP and cassette tape while drinking a drink or beer. Of course, you can also purchase. Famous artists come to shoot pictorial because of the vintage and analog atmosphere. In particular, the rooftop is a masterpiece. From the Namsan Seoul Tower to the Usadan-gil Dokkaebi Market, you can see the plastic tent at a glance. In between, old houses and alleys fill each other. Seoul, which embraces Usadan-gil, is far and warm. It is a moment to fully appreciate the essence of Usadan-gil, which sits on a high place.

    If you want to explore more of Itaewon's characteristic paths, go to Itaewon Antique Furniture Street. It originated from the purchase and sale of furniture sold by the U.S. military as it returned to its home country, and has now established itself as a representative street for selling antique furniture in Korea. Looking at classic and antique furniture and accessories, it feels like you are walking on a street in Europe.

    Itaewon's vintage charm continues in 'VINYL &amp; PLASTIC'. This place operated by Hyundai Card is a space full of analog sounds such as LP, CD, and cassette tape. The first floor mainly exhibits and sells LP, and the second floor exhibits and sells CDs, and turntables, cassette players, and CD players are available everywhere to enjoy music. It is a place where analog music evokes nostalgia to familiar generations and fresh stimulation to new generations familiar with digital sound sources.
