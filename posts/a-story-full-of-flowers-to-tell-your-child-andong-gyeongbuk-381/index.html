   Andong looks more amazing. Under the hanok that shows the beauty of the curves by combining Amki and Sukiwa, a concentrated mental culture makes the heart beat. Andong is the place where you do nothing and the night you ask at your home is the best gift. Kwon Jeong-saeng from the fairy tale Ganga Jitung, you can feel the sympathy in the fairy tale country, and spend a quiet time with the children at Hahoe Village, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are plenty of foods such as mackerel, Andong Korean beef, and Andong steamed chicken. 'Andong International Mask Dance Festival' is held for 10 days from the last Friday of September every year. Why don't you wear a Hahoe mask with your children and have fun playing?

   Andong's first travel destination with his children is the fairy tale of Kwon Jung-seng, the author of the well-known fairy tale ‘Gang-a-ji-tung’. The former Iljik Nambu Elementary School, which was closed school, was remodeled in October 2014 to recreate it as a space to feel the artist's breath and discover the concentricity of those who seek it.

    It is part of 《Gang-a-ji-tung》 written by Kwon Jeong-saeng, a child literature writer who dreamed of children's happiness. A child and a parent who only know the contents of a fairy tale are impressed by looking at the artist's biography and relics. Kwon Jeong-saeng, who lived in poverty with his soldiers for the rest of his life, left a passbook with 1 billion won in income for children. Based on this trend, Kwon Jeong-saeng Children's Cultural Foundation was established in 2009, and the Foundation is carrying out various welfare culture projects for children. "All of the books I write are mostly bought and read by children, so it's worth giving back the taxes that come out here." In the exhibition hall, the main scenes of the animation &lt;Gang-a-shit&gt; and the video related to the teacher are shown. The fairy tale book that reads to the child knowing the background of the author comes to another meaning.
