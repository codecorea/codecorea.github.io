   The spring breeze drinks a cup of hot coffee on the beach. The harmony of the sea and coffee enhances the value of relaxation.

   As is the case with Gangneung, there are more and more cafes on the beaches of Gangneung. In the old days, Gangneung Port Cafe Street was the center, and now you can find cafes on various beaches in Gangneung. Some prefer Gangneung Port Café Street, where many cafes are crowded, while others prefer quiet, quiet beachside cafes. Sacheonjin Beach and Yeongjin Beach are the places that many people with the latter taste find. If Gangneung Port Café Street is a big star, is Sacheonjin Beach and Yeongjin Beach an indie star with mania fans?
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Yeongjin Beach is located between Jumunjin Port and Sacheonjin Port. It is also the place where 12 courses of Baugil from Sacheonjin Beach to Jumunjin pass. On the shore of Yeongjin Beach, you can see the tranquil Yeongjin Port on one side and the bustling Order Port on the other. Yeongjin Beach has wide sandy beaches, clean, and light blue. The water is even brighter on sunny spring days. The water is shallow and the water is clean, so the floor is clearly visible. It is good to walk the trilogy while enjoying the warm sun. Soft sand and gentle spring light tickle the mind. There aren't many people, so it's great to enjoy a relaxing walk in spring. Add a cup of warm coffee to the spring sea walk, which still feels cold.

   There are not many cafes on the beach of Yeongjin, which looks like a peaceful fishing village. But it is also a special place with the history of Gangneung Coffee. Gangneung is a pioneer in establishing the city of coffee and Bohemian, one of Gangneung's two great mountains, is located on a small hill near Yeongjin Beach. If you enter the village from the beach, you can taste savory coffee in Bohemian, which is run by Park Yi-chu, a master of coffee.

   In front of Yeongjin Beach is 'Cafe Brazil' which started its business in 2008. A modern two storey building catches the eye. In the early days, single-storey houses were remodeled and operated as cafes. I roasted fresh coffee every day, serving high quality coffee.

   Squid Bread and Homemade Burger on Yeongjin Beach

  <div class="txt_p">
   If you're unhappy with a cup of coffee, you can go to the marshmallow and squid bread shop on Yeongjin beach. After walking out of Café Brazil, you will see a small two-story building with the big word squid bread. This shop features specialty breads made with Jumunjin's famous squid.

   If you think that the bread with red bean paste is 'there'll be there,' it is a miscalculation. Let's get rid of the preconception that squid and bread don't seem appropriate. Squid and bread create a harmonious taste. Contains squid powder and squid extract, as well as real squid. If you take a bite, savory squid and sweet bread taste at the same time. One by one, two go hand in hand.
