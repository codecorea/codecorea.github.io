    The landscape of yellow sunflowers is a dream. You can stroll through the sunflower field and think of Vincent van Gogh's Sunflower. The moment you step into the Taebaek Guwa Village, you will be immersed in the feast of sunflowers spreading in the summer.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The expression “sea of sunflowers” is not an exaggeration. Taebaek Guwa Village (Gowon Native Botanical Garden) is the most blooming sunflower in Korea. About 1 million sunflowers bloom each year. This area, which is 850 meters above sea level, was originally a highland Chinese cabbage field, but after planting sunflowers, it became the largest sunflower flower field in Korea.
   <br/>
   There are sunflowers in the hilly area of 160,000 m2. In terms of form, small fields and large fields are divided, and sunflowers bloom along the ridges and along the side roads. The flowering period is slightly different and varies from shyly opened petals to wide open flowers. Anyone who walks among the flowers that open up gorgeously becomes the main character of a dreamlike canvas.

   Sunflower Festival held every August
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Whether you're thinking alone in a sunflower field or enjoying a date with your lover, there's no one who cares. Everyone plays a leading or supporting role in the sunflower flower field with a big camera. When entering a large field, visitors' smiles open as much as petals. Anyone wearing a lens completes a photo that becomes art. It's like the magic of color produced by yellow sunflowers in a remote village in Baekdu-daegan.
    <br/>
    The town's name, Guwau, comes from the topography of nine cows lying down here. The village was located in a remote area, the watershed of the Baekdu-daegan and Nakdong veins. Sunflowers are in full bloom around mid-August. Adjusting the timing of sowing sunflowers has made it longer than ever before to see flowers.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    In Guwa Village, sunflower festivals are held every year according to the time of flowering. This year starts on July 27th and continues until August 17th. In addition to sunflowers during this period, you can also enjoy wildflowers along the Taebaek mountain range.
    <br/>
    The Sunflower Festival is accompanied by various programs under the theme of “Encounter of Nature and Art”. There will be a photo exhibition of sunflowers, an outdoor sculpture exhibition, insect gathering, and a sweet potato roasting experience. There is also an event to distribute sunflower seeds for free. If possible, avoiding the weekends is good for walking and taking pictures. It is convenient to check whether the flower garden is in full bloom before visiting and know the location of the flower garden in full bloom. The entrance fee to the Guwa Village during the festival is 5,000 won for adults and 3,000 won for students.
    <br/>
    When you visit Guwau Village, you can't miss the sight of Geomryongso, the birthplace of the nearby Han River. Geomryongso Ascending Trail, which extends 1.3km from Geomryongso Parking Lot, is a great place for families to enjoy the forest bathing.

   Cheoram Station regains warmth
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    When you go from Guwa Village to Cheoram, you can see the scenery that creates a different mood from the gorgeous flower garden in Taebaek. Cheoram area was once one of the most prosperous towns in Taebaek City with one of the most prestigious coal coal fields in Korea. The area around Cheoram Station, where merchants closed down and residents declined as the coal industry became speculative, has recently been spotlighted.
    <br/>
    Cheoram Station is the starting and ending station of V-Train, a gorge train between Baekdu-daegan that started operating this year. Leading the tourists who got off the train is a crude road from the station to Cheoramcheon to Sambang Village. It brings warmth to the old history and villages where some themes are forgotten.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    As you climb towards Dal-dong, the old low-cartage spreads out under your feet. The Cheoram Yeokdo Line, where stockpiled coal is accumulated, is listed as National Registered Cultural Property No. 21. Fighting scenes of the movie &lt;There Is No Things to See&gt; were also unfolded at this dock. Cheoram Station has recently been known as the filming location for the drama &lt;The Most High Yi Sunshin&gt;, and the footsteps of young travelers have continued.
    <br/>
    Overlooking Cheoram Station and Mine, Sambang-dong is transforming into a mural village. Although the empty houses left by the owner reveal a rare appearance, the town is regaining warmth with light and color on the walls and tourists. The old buildings on Cheoram Stream will be preserved without breaking down, and will be refurbished as a coal mine historical experience village. Cheoram is also close to the Taebaek Highland Natural Recreation Forest, and is a great place to end your Taebaek trip. The feast of splendid sunflowers and the spirit of the simple coal mine village can be arranged in the cool recreation forest of Taebaek.
