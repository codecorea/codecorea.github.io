   Bangokji is a “green spot for taking pictures” selected by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. Even as usual, old willow trees reflect on the waterside to create a picturesque landscape, and in April, radiant flowers are in full bloom, making the photo zone everywhere.

   Bangokji is an agricultural reservoir created in 1903. The king willows are planted on the northeastern bank of 150m, boasting a picturesque scenery. The highest age is estimated at 200 or 300 years. For a time, only those who liked photography secretly visited it and called it the "second main production area." He became more famous after filming the dramas &lt;Arang Sato Exhibition&gt;, &lt;The Dream of the Great&gt;, and the movie &lt;Heo Samgwan&gt;.

   The watershed area of Bangokji is 79ha, and the water storage capacity is 3,9300 tons. The original name of Bangokji was called Oebanji, which was derived from the village's administrative name, Bangok-ri. Prior to the consolidation of administrative districts in 1914, Bangok-ri was Oeban-ri and Naeban-ri. The lower village of Bangokji was the outer village and the upper village of Bangokji was the inner village. The inner and outer classes are derived from the village topography that looks like a soban in the valley at the foot of Samsung Mountain.

   Bungokji Willow willows tend toward the waterfront and lean back and forth. There is a grand and majestic fashion. The king willows are reflected in the semicircle, adding a sense of luck. The scenery changes every morning, evening, and season, so it's new whenever you find it. As the name of Bangok-ri came from ‘Valley that resembles Soban’, the surrounding mountains have reservoirs and villages, and there is no hassle. It's also good for a short break and soothing your tired body and mind. Nevertheless, it is quite crowded in early and mid-April. This is why radiant flowers bloom.

   A deck walkway was created across the reservoir. Bangokji is on the left and radiant flowers are on the right side. There is a 2nd floor pavilion next to the parking lot. From the top, you can take a picture with a view of Bangokji. The fresh green of the king willow and the pink color of the radiant flower contrast. The scenery is beautiful in the early morning or on a rainy day, and the mist is mysterious in the mountains behind the radiant flowers.

   Usually, the road from Daegu City or Gyeongsan Station to Bangokji is the north side of the Ring Road after passing through Samsung Prefectural History and Culture Park. Most of them return to the road they came from, but it is a step further south. Seongsan-ro in the direction of Jogok-ri is a hidden spot for radiant flower viewing in Namsan-myeon. The road in the lane of the second lane is a radiant flower field. As the light slope rises and falls, the flower scenery on the road is more dramatic. You can enjoy the flower road drive at a slow speed.

   Bangokji is available for day trips using public transportation. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes to travel from KTX Dongdaegu Station to Gyeongsan Station, one train every 30 to 40 minutes. From Gyeongsan Station to Bangokji, you can go directly to the city bus, but if you consider the time of delivery, go to Jain-myeon and take a taxi (about 8,000 won). Seongsan-ro radiant flower road from Bangok-ri to Jogok-ri is also about 1.5km away, so you can take a walk on foot (because there are no extra roads in India). You can take a taxi from Jogok-ri to Jain Bus Station, and the fare is 8,000 ~ 9000 won. However, Bangokji is still a hidden spot without the common cafe or convenience store. It is a good idea to prepare light foods such as water or snacks in advance.

   When traveling by car, about 4 km from Bangokji Temple, Samsung Prefectural History and Culture Park is a suitable travel destination. Moreover, it is the way to Gyeongsan downtown. The park honors Samsung County (Wonhyo, Seolchong, Ilyeon) produced by Gyeongsan City. There is a cultural center in the center, and the permanent exhibition halls, such as the Wonhyo room, the Seolseol room, and the Ilyeon room, are basically operated. The story of Wonhyo's skeleton, the son of Wonhyo's son Seolchong, and the process of birth of Ilyeon's &lt;The Three Kingdoms&gt; are famous stories in textbooks. It's worth taking a look around as it gives children a chance to tell what they know.

    Spending time outdoors in spring is another way. As a park, there are plenty of shelter, such as a central plaza, a labyrinth, and an outdoor performance hall. The observation deck features a panoramic view of the Samsung Prefectural History and Culture Park and the surrounding area of the blooming flower. Relative hot springs are located 1.7 km away from Samsung Prefectural Museum of History and Culture from Bangokji. The facility is old due to the alkaline hot spring, but is lightly relaxing.

   In Jain-myeon, adjacent to Namsan-myeon, there is Jain Account Forest, Gyeongsangbuk-do Monument No. 123. Natural forests are usually located in mountainous areas, but zain account forests are rarely hilly. Ipop trees, zelkova trees, etc., form a lush forest. Until the beginning of April, the wild plant hornhorn color is a highlight of Jain Account Forest.

   You can find it now, but if you want to feel it right, we recommend a trip in connection with the Bangokji on the 5th of May (June 7 of this year). The Gyeongsan Jain Dan Oje Festival is held to see the Hanjanggun Daeje, Yeowonmu, etc. The main stage is Jain Account Forest and Samsung Prefectural History and Culture Park. Prior to this, in May, the e-pop trees are in full bloom on the streets of Wonhyo-ro connecting Dongbu-dong and Jain-myeon in Gyeongsan-si to relieve the regret of those who missed the copy flowers.
