   Summer is the best trip to Gangneung. From Jumunjin to Gyeongpo, Jeongdongjin, and Okgye, large and small beaches spread out along the coastline. Among them, Jeong Dong-jin is a fantastic combination of the sea, train tracks, mountains and art. Brush-dense forest faces the sea, and there are countless works of art in harmony with the sea. Jeongdongjin Station is a different name for romance. Jeongdongjin area is close to the sea, rail bike, Hasla Art World and Gangneung Unification Park, so you can enjoy them as a day course.

   Gangneung Unification Park consists of a ship exhibition hall located on the beach from Anin beach to Jeongdongjin, a unification security exhibition hall located on the mountain a little distance away, and an outdoor exhibition hall. Most of the tourists visit only the wartime exhibition halls with easy access and many attractions. The Jeonbuk ship, located in the center of the ship exhibition hall, was built in 1944 in the United States, and was a destroyer that defended the territorial waters of Korea until the Korean navy came in 1972 and retired in 1999. It is 118m long, 12.5m wide and 27.4m high and weighs 3471 tons. Inside, you'll feel like you're looking for a labyrinth when you're in the captain's room, steering room, meeting room, infirmary, electric room, barber's room, kitchen, etc.

   It's a trap made in 1944, so it's a huge antique museum full of old objects. Complex machinery, ceilings and devices are impressive. The front and stern decks are open to the public, and they are equipped with various facilities and weapons to impress them. The deep blue sea of the sea overlooking the ship is fascinating.

   It is located on the hillside overlooking the seaside of Myeongmyeong Beach, and the scenery of the sea is excellent. The sea cafe at the entrance to the open-air sculpture park spread the deck wide and made it an observatory. To the right, you can see Eomyeong Beach and Jeongdongjin far away. Widely covering the sky, the work 'Morning Glory' is a symbol of Haslla Art World. As you can see from Mondrian's abstraction, the main building with colorful colored glass on the outside is also impressive.

   Hasla Art World is home to an outdoor sculpture park, Pinocchio &amp; Marionette Museum, hotels, restaurants, sea cafes and observation decks, and art shops and galleries. If you are traveling with a child, it is a good idea to try art first. There are various experiences, such as making a moving marionette doll, making a wooden picture frame, drawing your own T-shirt, and making a kangaroo doll.

   The Outdoor Sculpture Park is the highlight of Haslla Art World. The promenade next to the art experience room is the starting point of the sculpture park. There are works all around the promenade, on the branches, under the rocks, and so on. There are many tall pine trees and the sea spread over it seems to see a picture of simple fashion. There are many works that you can enjoy while playing, such as the cow dung art museum with cow dung material hanging in the air, the stone gallery with hanging stones, and the square of time where sundials and aisles are installed. At the Sky Observatory, don't miss the shadow bikes that seem to run upside down.

   Choose from 2 or 4 people and listen to the instructions for safety and safety after boarding. If you roll your foot only a couple of times at first, the motorized function will work afterwards. Children are cheering as they run alongside the sea. Four-seater seats are pedaled by hand instead of feet. It runs well without having to turn the hand pedal, but keeps spinning for fun. The people strolling on the beach wave their hands, and the people waiting for the train at Jeongdongjin station look at them enviously. Both the rail biker and the spectator are happy. Unfortunately, for a while, you will not be able to ride the Jungdongjin rail bike.

   Jungdongjin Station still runs trains. In addition to the regular trains, special trains that enjoy the sea scenery of the East Sea called 'sea trains' are operated twice a weekday and three times a weekend. During the peak summer season, it runs three times on weekdays. It takes about 1 hour 20 minutes and 3 hours round trip to Samcheok via the East Sea. The train runs along the coastline for a great view of the sea.
