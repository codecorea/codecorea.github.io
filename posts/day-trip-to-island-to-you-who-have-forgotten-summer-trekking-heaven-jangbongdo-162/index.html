   Among them, Jangbong-do is famous for a day-trip trekking spot. The name means `` island with long peaks, '' but there are seven trekking courses along the ridge and coast. Each course has different charms and features, including a fresh course on the 1st course from the marina to the middle of the island, as well as the sky path, the road beyond Gugi, the road to Jangbong Coast, the road to Yadal Mermaid, the path to Handeul Coast, and the path to Jangbong Treasure.

   Except for the 1st and 2nd courses across the central part of the island, they are all coastal walks along the sea. The sea seen from here is incredibly clean and blue, not to be believed to be the West Sea. At this time, most of the daytime, more of the low tide and tidal flats are revealed, but even this is just beautiful. The sandy tidal flat where the tidal flat meets the tidal rock is called ‘Got Tea’. This is the reason why the name “Got Ti-gil” was named on the trekking course of Jangbong-do.

   Twenty-five (one-way) flights a day also allow for a one-day trip. From Yeongjongdo Sammok Wharf, there are one or two ships heading to Jangbong-do almost every hour from 7:10 am to 8:40 pm. It takes about 40 minutes to depart from Sammok and arrive at Jangbongdo via Shindo. Passenger cars and freight cars are also available. Detailed timetable

   Many people are famous for their beautiful sunsets. On the left side of the observatory, you can see the twin uninhabited islands of Seomando and Dongmando side by side. In winter, the sun falls exactly between the two islands. Wherever it goes, it's every thing that you're ecstatic. However, if you do not have specialized equipment such as lanterns, you must hurry up Hassan.

    A trekking paradise is not a smooth road. There are few decks or stairs and most of them are made of dirt and rocks, which can be difficult for those unfamiliar with climbing. In addition, grass and trees are lush when there is a shower in the summer, making some areas uncomfortable. The fresh play path and the sky path (under difficulty) stretching along the main ridgeline are relatively wide and flat, but the Jangbong Coastal Path (on difficulty level) is narrow and rough, so it is recommended to avoid trekking beginners as much as possible. Even if it is not a coastal road, keep in mind that Jangbongdo itself has long ridges and repeats the uphill and downhill paths, so it is easy to get tired even if the course is short.

    ① Beach with tidal flats
    <br/>
   </strong>
   There are 5 beaches in Jangbong-do. Ongam Beach, the closest to the marina, is a representative tourist attraction with various restaurants and convenient facilities. On weekends, camping crowds are so crowded that the field is filled with tents. The wide tidal flat is a playground for children to play freely. 뙤 It's busy picking up shellfish or crabs without worrying about the sun. Jangbongdo is a mudflat everywhere. In the distant sea, there are several places of grass. In some places, the depths are deep and the water is fast. It was called the golden fishing ground from the Joseon Dynasty for a good reason.

   There are also mermaid legends related to abundant fishery resources. The fisherman Choi Choi, who hit the ball every day, was delighted to find a mermaid caught in the net one day, but the eyes seemed so sad that he put it back to the sea, and since then, every time a fisherman throws a net, a fish is caught. In fact, you can meet a mermaid statue built at the dock in Jangbongdo to remember the mermaid's boeun.

   </strong>
   Sanghap, Sora, and clams are seafood representing Jangbongdo. The elderly in the village go out near the grass and offshore in small streets to catch up. Mussels are lilies belonging to the most expensive species of shellfish. It is caught a lot in the nearby tidal flats, but the bigger and better the competition is, the farther it goes out to sea. Sora is the same. It comes from the tidal flats and from the sea, and the mussel is bigger and tastes better. The collected sashimi is purchased at the village restaurant. Mussels and clams are kalguksu, and sora is served in bibimbap.
