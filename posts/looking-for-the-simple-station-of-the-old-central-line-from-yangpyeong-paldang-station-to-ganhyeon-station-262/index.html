    More than 20 years ago, I thought of a trip on the Jungang Line Pigeon Lake from Cheongnyangni.

   When you go to Gangwon-do or the East Coast, Guri and Namyangju are the places you can pass by. Nowadays, there are many new paths, so the route to Gangwon-do is diverse, but in the past, going to Chuncheon or Wonju had to go through the Donongsamgeori in front of the Namyangju Police Station.

   From here, heading towards Wonju, passing Deokso to Yangpyeong, ran along the Jungang Line railroad. Sometimes I ran side by side or crossed each other, and I met faces with passengers in a train. Such a central railroad track was transformed into a double track railroad track after several years of construction. As the new train line was laid, the fate of the old Jungang Line was mixed. After removing the railroad tracks, it became a bicycle path, or the use of it for rail bikes changed, or some sections disappeared. All that's left is to lose some railroad tracks and only a few simple stations.

   After passing Deokso and near Paldang Station, there are several bicycle rental shops along the road. In recent years, the vicinity of Paldang has emerged as a bicycle mecca. Although many bicycle paths have been opened along the river stalks across the country, there are few places that are as nice as the Paldang ~ Yangsuri ~ Yangpyeong section.

   From Yongmun, get off the national road and enter the 341 local road. The area around Jipyeong-myeon, centered on Jipyeong Station, was where the United Nations and the People's Liberation Army of China fought fiercely during the Korean War. Since the winter of 1951, the Allied Forces, which have been pushed by the Chinese military offensive, hold a commemorative event every year in honor of their successful counterattack. However, the Jipyeong Station Square, where the event is held, has recently been newly constructed, making it difficult to find old traces.
