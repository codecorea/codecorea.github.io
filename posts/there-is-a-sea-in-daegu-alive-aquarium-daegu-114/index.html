   A hot place like an oasis has appeared in Daegu surrounded by mountains such as Palgongsan and Bisleul Mountain. The main character is 'Alive Aquarium Daegu', which was ambitiously presented at Shinsegae Department Store Daegu. It's a sea in the inland city.

   Alive Aquarium Daegu (hereafter Alive Aquarium) can be found on the 9th floor, the top floor of Shinsegae Department Store Daegu Main Building. It is an aquarium set in the highest position in Korea. The sea creatures on display are about 200 species, including manatees, California sea lions and zebra sharks. Viewing routes consisted of a one-way that allows you to look around all the exhibition spaces from the entrance to the exit in one direction. It is about 800m long and takes about 95 minutes.

   The first thing you'll encounter past the entrance to the Alive Aquarium is the jellyfish aquarium, which embellishes the interior with a fluorescent sky. The moment you see it, it is a sight that makes you resilient. As the jellyfish floats across the cylindrical aquarium, spreading its caps, a small full moon, like its name (full moon jellyfish), floats. Elegant movements that cannot be imitated by any living creature add to the ever-changing lighting, giving you a slightly dreamy atmosphere. The jellyfish aquarium is mirrored on four sides, creating a magnificent view.

   Cafés and kids zones greet visitors as they pass by the fish tank and photo tank where you can take commemorative photos. Kids Zone has a touch pool where children can touch eel and octopus, and a facility where children can play with various toys. There is a sketch aquarium on one wall. After coloring the paper on which the sea creatures are drawn, scan the finished picture on the device and the animal appears on the screen to swim.

   The Manatee Aquarium reproduces the depth of Manatee's main habitat, a lagoon (a shallow lake separated from the sea by sedimentary obstacles such as sand). Manatee eats 20 kg of vegetables per day, including bok choy, cabbage, cabbage, and jerk. It's interesting to see how people use their hands to eat vegetables as if they were people. Excessive amounts of waste are excreted frequently, which feed on omnivorous fish in the same aquarium.
