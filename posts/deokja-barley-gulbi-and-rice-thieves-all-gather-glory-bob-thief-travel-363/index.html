After scooping up a spoonful of rice on the barley tea, then tearing the dried oysters to the side and dipping it in red pepper paste to eat it. When Gulbi, Gwangju Beopseongpo comes to mind first. This is because the oyster stew dried in the sea wind of Beopseongpo, pickled in natural salt of Glory, whether it is a natural reference machine or a cultivated cultivated product, is the best. It was called ‘Jogi (해서)’ because it has the effect of boosting the body's energy. It is rich in protein and calcium, so it is also excellent for growth and rejuvenation.

The owner of the Beopseongpo Gulbi-sik set about December 20 to hang the gulbi and collect it when the wind is coldest for about two months. You shouldn't be hard on your liver, so you need to keep the dates accurate. This is because the taste of oysters varies depending on the process of seasoning with sea salt and drying in the sea breeze.

   Beopseongpo Gulbi Restaurant is located in Golbi Alley, Beopseongpo, with the Sea of Chilsan in between. It is not unusual that the 6-year-old old paper that was soaked in preparation for the opening of the restaurant is served with gulbi set's Hongeo Samhap. If you just tell the story of Gulbi in front of the owner or employee of your hometown, or at the table, you are a prominent liquidator. While applying barley gulbi and grilled oysters to eat, the history of Beopseongpo and the pride of gulbi are delicious.

   Dukja is characterized by its large size, and its fins black. It is more delicious than octopus and has a softer taste. Deokja is rich in protein and unsaturated fatty acids, and rich in amino acids such as taurine and glutamic acid, making it excellent for rejuvenation and good for people with skin problems. As it is tasty and rich in nutritional value, it is priced as a cigar. The price varies from 50,000 to 70,000 won depending on the size of the fish that comes in every day, and when you make a reservation, it is cooked for 3 to 4 servings.

   The first secret of Haechon Restaurant's food taste is to cook only the creatures without using frozen fish in any season. The second trick is to use generously red pepper powder purchased from Gwanggwang and season with the miso and red pepper paste to match the seasoning. The third trick is to season with fresh ingredients such as fresh garlic and scented ginger and sweet onions.

   If you look at the cooking process of Deokja steamed, it is more like boiled than steamed. The fish is so thick that it starts stewing an hour before the reservation. Deokja-jjim, which is made by dipping Dukja in an airy seasoning sauce, boils down, and tastes delicious with plump and light flesh. Even if you eat fish meat and marinade with rice, the two tastes are sharp and cool. At Haechon Restaurant, two air per person is natural. When steamed with savory and spicy duck, a side dish of fresh seaweed is the basis for two rice.
