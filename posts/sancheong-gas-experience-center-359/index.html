    The spiritual energy of the universe is called reiki. People live on crossroads. If there is no energy, it is a dead life. The city people were tired of running away from the stress.

   Jirisan is a mountain where even a foolish person turns into a wise person by stepping on it. Sancheong-gun is one of the towns of Jiri Mountain. There are many medicinal herbs in Jirisan, the young mountain of the nation. It is natural that the mountains are high and the valleys are deep. Sancheong-gun combined the mysterious image of Jirisan Herb with tourism. As the main mountain of herbal medicine, Donguibogamchon was built at the foot of Wangsan (923m) and Pilbongsan (848m) to the north of Jiri. Looking east from the courtyard of the Oriental Medicine Museum (Donguibogam), Hwangmaesan, famous for its azaleas, comes into view.

   Sancheong is not only a hometown for herbal medicine, but also a homegrown city. First of all, there are brothers Heo Young and Heon from Danseong-myeon. His older brother, Heo Young, was well-prescribed, and his younger brother, Cho Sam Heon, was famous for acupuncture. Next, there is Yoo Yi-tae, a native of Geochang who performed medical activities in Sancheong, where there is a family. He has written works such as The Margin, The Experiment Room, and The Introspection. Heojun's teacher, Ryu Ui-tae, who built The Dongui Bogam, is also from Sinan-myeon, Sancheong-gun.

   The Sancheong Gas Experience Center was created in the highest place in Donguibogamchon. The road in the complex, which started from Bulmunmun, passes through the museum and becomes higher altitude. There is a fenced trail along the side of the driveway. This path is called Donguibogam Dulle-gil. When you finally arrive in front of the Palgakjeong Pavilion and pull your car around, you will see a two-story super-large hanok. The building, which covers approximately 460 square meters, is expected to be completed by the end of August 2013. After it is built, it is said to be used as a place for physical and mental medicine, such as cardio training, yoga, and meditation.

   Turtle rock and Seokkyung, hidden in the hillside behind the two-story hanok, have already been rumored to be a 'good place to receive flags', and many people are looking for them. The turtle rock that stands vertically in the middle of the stone axis is called ‘Gwagamseok’. The earstone backboard, which is about 4 times as tall as an adult, has hexagonal shapes that extend out in all directions like a shell of a turtle, and hieroglyphs are engraved on each one.
   <br/>
   Good ears wishing to be done in everyday life are engraved on the earstones that convey the energy of the earth, so that the visitors can receive their wishes and make wishes. The rock, weighing about 130 tons, is from Hwangmaesan.
   <br/>
   In front of Seokkyung, just above the earstone, gather not only the energy of the earth but also the energy of the sky. The letters engraved on the stone also have similar meanings to those of the ear stone. A letter was carved out of a stone that was picked up from Beomhak Village in Sancheong-eup.

   Minhyang-sik, a cultural tourism commentator, says that if you hold this rock with both hands, take a deep breath while holding your chest and head, and meditate, you can experience the energy of the earth permeating the whole body.
   <br/>
   “In a word, just standing in front of the earrings and stone mirrors, the energy of the earth is transmitted to the human body, and it seems that the lost energy is revived and the head is cleared.”
   <br/>
   Directly above the ear persimmon, there is an enormous stone view enclosed within the pavilion, which, like the ear persimmon, is a place where you can receive energy. Experiencers take a comfortable posture once again in front of Seok-kyung and once again in front of Seok-kyung, and then embrace the energy of the earth, that is, the earth.

   There is a simple way to test how much the limpid stone in front of Gwaseokseok and Seokkyung is. Stand about 10m from this place, draw a circle with your thumb and forefinger, and try to separate it from the people around you. This time, move to the front of Gwagamseok and Seokkyung, and then take the same action and try the same action. Commentator Minh Hyang-sik explains, “Even if you are not particularly conscious or empowered, you can feel that it is difficult and easy to remove, because the power of ki acts.” He occasionally demonstrates a gas tank to experienced guests during the explanation. Experienced people can easily follow.

   The place where the energy of the land is good is called Myeongdang. In Sancheong, a mountainous country, this place is located in Wangsan, a road leading from the Cheonwangbong (1,915m) of Jirisan to Hwangmaesan (1,108m). The base of the two mountains meets in one place, and the Moon Pilbong stands right next to it, so it is spotlighted as a place of prayer. Munpilbong refers to the shape of a mountain peak with a pointed shape like the tip of a brush. A lot of people are produced in these places.
