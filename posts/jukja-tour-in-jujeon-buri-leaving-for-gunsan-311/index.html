    Gunsan is a modern historical city. There are many red houses with traces of the Japanese colonial rule all over the old city center, and there are many cultural heritages such as Gujosun Bank, Gugun San Customs, and Museum of Modern History. You can also meet the old railroad tracks that were being robbed of rice wine. However, this trip is not a tour of Gunsan's modern cultural heritage.

   Lee Seongdang that comes to mind immediately after Gunsan
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Old bakeries that have accumulated time and taste for many years in the whole country since 2-3 years ago are booming. For that reason, these days, I think of the Lee Seongdang when I am Gunsan. Lee Seongdang's red bean bread became a snack that I would definitely want to try once I went to Gunsan, and thanks to the mass media, I couldn't easily taste it even when I went to Gunsan.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   After liberation, Iseongdang's most famous red bean bread and vegetable bread, which have a history of 67 years, are grilled several times a day. The bread comes out at a fixed time on that day, and the tray of red bean bread is exposed to the floor, scaring the bread out, as the waiting customers buy several dozen pieces at a time to compensate for the time. The quick hands of customers who want to occupy the bread before it cools down are the first to cool down. So, sweet bean bread or vegetable bread may limit the number of breads that can be bought per person.

    One warm red bean bread that was tasted after the twists and turns comforts the tiredness of waiting. The sweet red bean bread filled with light and sweet bean jam is soft and soft, and the crispy vegetable bread that my mom bought at the childhood market is the same as it used to be. It is worthwhile to try and visit. In fact, the bread feels better because of the wait and excitement until it comes out. The sadness of not being able to live at any time at any time, the joy of taking the bread that everyone wants to buy, and the expectations of a single bread from far away to broke up can make you feel more delicious than it really is.

   About 70% of Iseongdang's bread is mixed with rice flour, and some are made with 100% rice flour. Among them, blue bread is 100% rice flour bread. Bread made from chewy and easy-to-digest rice flour is a great substitute for meals. From 8am to 10am, the Iseongdang sells a morning set of fried eggs, soup, coffee and sandwiches. It has been popular since ancient times when it was longing for a Western breakfast. Business hours are from 8 am to 10:30 pm (closed fluidly).

   When you look around Gunsan's old town, you will often see a Chinese restaurant. There are only a number of Chinese houses that are famous for Champon. Bokseongru and Ssangyong Banjeom are more popular champon restaurants for foreigners, and movie theaters, Seowon Banjeom and Binhaewon are recommended by Gunsan citizens. Bokseongru is famous for champon with pork garnish, and Ssangyong spot is famous for its seafood-rich champon.

   The Middle East hotteokjip (traditional hotteokjip), which was often imagined and visited at a stand, was a clean shop. Originally it started in a shabby house right in front of you, but it looks like you bought a building that made a lot of money with hotteok. There are 3 to 4 tables to eat and go to Hotteokjip, and there are free coffee vending machines and water purifiers in clean toilets. What's even more surprising is the numbering machine I only saw at banks. Even on weekdays, you must draw a number tag and wait a long time before the order in which you can order is returned. It doesn't suit the hotteokjip, but it's a comforting part, not a line.

   Two tongs are given to those who eat and go to the table. After tearing the hotteok with these tongs, peel off the blood on the top, dip it in the syrup inside, and eat it first. This way, you don't spill syrup in the hotteok, you can eat it neatly, and you can feel the taste of hotteok more clearly. Anyone who has tasted Middle East hotteok is worth visiting. However, it is also important to keep in mind that the packaging tastes much less. Business hours are from 10 am to 7 pm (Closed on Sundays)

   One of the specialties that I learned only after coming to Gunsan is Japtang. Japtang is a snack that is enjoyed by high school girls in Gunsan, and a favorite food for adults who enjoyed japtang in their youth. Japtang is a soup made with tteokbokki, dumplings, fish cakes, eggs, noodles, ramen, and boiled. It is characterized by boiling in a large pot, thanks to which you can feel the deep taste of the pot.

   As reflected in the history of Gunsan, a port city that has absorbed a variety of cultures and people for the past 100 years, the taste of jjatang boiled all together is thick and rich. Rather than frying one of the ingredients, the natural taste that harmonizes various types of foods resembles Gunsan. Even at first glance, it seems like a small meal, but the history of jjotang in Gunsan has been over 40 years. Still, he is still young compared to other snacks. Even now, the cheap and hearty jjatang that fills students' hungry stomach is the most famous of the two-screw necks in Myeongsan-dong, and there are some more jjajangjips in the neighborhood.
