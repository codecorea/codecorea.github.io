The temperature fell like a lie when I arrived at Daegwallyeong on the highway in the heat of over 30 degrees. The wind was cool and the air was clear. In the evening, I had to take out long clothes, and on some days, the temperature dropped below 20 degrees. It&#39;s not an exaggeration to say that I have been to the sea and the valley, but there is no summer resort like Daegwallyeong.

    This summer, which was unusually hot, swept across the country, but only some mountainous areas in Gangwon-do, such as Daegwallyeong, were excluded from the heat wave. The temperature fell like a lie when I arrived at Daegwallyeong on the highway in the heat of over 30 degrees. The wind was cool and the air was clear.

   Daegwallyeong is not only cool, but also full of interesting attractions. The most popular place in the Daegwallyeong area of Pyeongchang is the Alpensia Resort, which will be the stage for the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Even outside the highway, entering the town of Hoenggye has a different temperature from the outside world.

  <div class="txt_p">
   First, let's take a look at the ski jumping tower, a landmark of Alpensia. The ski jumping tower, which was completed in 2009 and began to be opened to the public in 2010, is also the location of the film &lt;National Team&gt;. At the main stadium of the sports park, the ski slopes of steep slopes come in at a glance. The impression of the fact that the skiing competition will be held at the Winter Olympics is truly impressive.

   If you can't get to the castle just by looking from below, take the monorail and go up the ski jumping tower. When you reach the tower for about 5 minutes, take the elevator again to the ski jump, sky lounge and observation deck. The ski jump stands on the 2nd and 3rd floors are for athletes only and are not allowed to enter the public. However, if you participate in the guided program, you can get down to the ski jump on the 2nd floor to listen to explanations and tour the facilities. If you stand on the ski jump for athletes, players who ski down the steep slopes are just respectable.

     Samyang Ranch boasts the largest in the East

   </div>

  <div class="txt_p">
   There are many places to visit in the ranch, including ostrich, sheep, and cow pastures, and a ranch observatory overlooking the East Sea on a clear day, and a well-maintained railroad path. If you are not confident of walking through the entire section, you can use the free shuttle bus that runs inside the ranch. Because it operates by section, some sections may be walked and some sections may use a bus. Or you can take the bus when you go up and walk when you go down.
