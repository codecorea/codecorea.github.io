   'Dongyi' Sookbin Choi's original review, Goryeongsan Bogwangsa Temple
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    There are exceptionally many cemeteries in Paju. It is a comfortable sanctuary for the dead and a place of longing for the living. It's ugly, but I think I can't help getting used to it for some reason. The road to Bokwangsa Temple, the original source of the Soryeongwon where Sookbin Choi is asleep, also goes through this path.
    <br/>
    Goyang-dong Goyang-dong is bordered by Paju-si. In order to go to Bogwangsa Temple, you have to cross one of the rough heads called Jakbak Pass. The name of the head, which is named because it looks like a head, is quite steep enough to be called “the limit of Paju”.
    <br/>
    As soon as you cross the park, you pass right around Bogwangsa Temple. It is a quiet forest path leading to Bogwangsa Temple. Goryeong Mountain, inhabited by Bogwangsa Temple, is a mountain with a divine name. Bogwangsa Temple was originally called Goryeongsa Temple, but since then it has been changed to Bogwangsa Temple. Bogwangsa Temple is a millennium review that was established by Doseon Guksa in the Unified Silla period as a Buddhist temple. Although it burned during the Korean War and the Imjin War, there are still traces of the royal palace touches and cabinets for Daeungbojeon.

    Sukbin Choi was originally Musuri, who served Queen Inhyun, the queen of King Sukjong. In 1689, a major incident occurred in which Queen Inhyeon was destroyed. When Hee-bin Jang became queen, she, who served Queen In-hyun, suffered a lot of trouble. Every day, I prayed for the reinstatement of Queen Inhyeon, but one day, after wearing Sukjong's Seung Eun, she went through a longing to reach the status of Vienna, the first item in the list. Her son Yeongjo later became King of the 21st Joseon Dynasty following King Sukjong and King Gyeongjong, but she did not become the queen. This is because Sukjong, who feared that Mr. Heebin Jang's tragedy would be repeated, forbade him to rise from court lady to queen. Was it because of that? During the long reign, Yeongjo tried to win his mother Sukbin Choi as a queen, and upgraded Sukbin's grave to a land palace and Sukbin grave to a major rank. It was from this time that Bogwangsa became involved with the royal family. Youngjo used Bogwangsa as the patrol of the Major General, and concentrated on Daeungbojeon and Manseru. And at the beginning of each month, I went over the park and met my mother. It seems that Yeongjo lowered his head and called it “the digging head” because it looks like this head is split.

   Bogwangsa Temple is a temple filled with Yeongjo's extreme filial piety. Yeongjo's filial piety is conveyed by Eosilgak and the juniper tree standing in front of it. Eosilgak is a small cabinet that enshrines Sukbin Choi's Youngjeong and his status. On the front and side, the roof of the roof is placed in the middle of a square with a private roof.

   A bunch of juniper trees are quite standing in front of them. This juniper tree, which is more than 300 years old, is said to have been planted together when Yeongjo created Eosilgak.

   In addition, traces of Yeongjo can be found all over Bogwangsa Temple. Yeongjo largely tackled Boungsa Temple's Daeungbojeon and Manseru, and engraved his writings on the Daeungbojeon plaque. The hanging signboard of Daeungbojeon is currently known as the handwriting of Yeongjo. Daewoongbojeon and Manseru are the special traces of Yeongjo's hand, since Yeongjo was in the middle of the Korean War and was not burning during the Korean War.

   Daewoongbojeon, which sits on a pile of stones, goes well with the mountains of Goryeong Mountain. Bogungsa Temple Daeungbojeon has a unique exterior wall that cannot be found in other temples. In other temples, most of the walls are lime-painted, except for the frontal gates. In Bogwangsa Temple, Daeungbojeon is surrounded by wooden panels that surround the left and right sides. In addition, murals on the 10 panel walls are a mixture of Buddhist paintings and folk paintings.

    Standing at the foot of the eastern foot of Yongamsa Temple, the statue of Maae-i Buddha in Yongmi-ri, Paju, is a typical stone statue of the Goryeo Dynasty, which is designated as Treasure No. 93. It is a unique Buddha statue engraved on a huge natural rock wall with a magical technique and made with a separate neck, head, and shade. After moving a large stone and placing it on a natural rock wall, the Buddha's face was carved. The stone Buddha on the left is a godly figure wearing a round shade and holding a lotus flower. It is a stone Buddha that tells the story of the king's 13th king, King Seonjong's concubine, the original shrine of King Seongjong, who gave birth to Wang Yun after giving birth to the request of a high priest.
