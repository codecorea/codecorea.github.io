   The view of the gorge created by the stream of the Nakdong River spreads out of the car window. You will never see it when you travel by car. It is a scenery that can only be met by climbing the V-train and Baekdu-daegan gorge train. The pine trees growing in the rocks and the beautifully colored larch are as close to touching as you can. Let's get on a three-car train that will make your memories unforgettable.

   The three-day V-Train that travels between Cheoram Station in Taebaek-si, Gangwon-do and Buncheon Station in Bonghwa-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do three times a day, is a three-car tourist train that meets closely the gorge of the canyon created by the stream of the Nakdong River. Because it is a train that passes deeply through the V-shaped canyon, it has the name V-train. From Cheoram, you will travel by train for about 1 hour and 10 minutes from Seokpo Station and Seungbu Station to Yangwon Station and Bidong Station to reach Buncheon.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The picturesque scenery that stretches out of the window is only accessible by train. This is because Seungbu Station, Yangwon Station, and Bidong Station are not connected by road and cannot be reached by car. It is also the reason why many travelers make a reservation and take the Gorge Train between Baekdu-daegan. Taebaek Cheoram Station and Bonghwa Buncheon Station, where trains depart, are always crowded with excitement and excitement.

    It is also worth taking a short trip to Cheoram while waiting for the Baekdu-daegan train departing from Cheoram. Cheoram is the largest coal mine facility in Korea built during the Japanese occupation. As coal was transported to the whole country through this place, many people once lived, but it is still as if the clock stopped in the 1970s. Around the Cheoram Station, there are murals depicting the stories of former workers at the Tantanjang and their families. When you cross the bridge in front of Cheoram Station, the empty houses lined up along the stream show an unusual scenery.

A locomotive that resembles a baby tiger that has been walking around Baekdu-daegan and a train with an exotic yet cute pink appearance catches the eye.

The unexplored gorge reaches its peak in the section from Seungbu Station to Yangwon Village. The V-train runs along the stream of the Nakdong River, which originates from Taebaek and flows south, as if stroking the gorge of the gorge.
