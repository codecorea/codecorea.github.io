   "Ari and Ari and Ariari. Ari and pass me over your head." Arirang melodies are melted in Jeongseon. Arirang, which is called at the lowest point of life, is intimately attached to our lives and narrates love, farewell, coalition, and lament. The vibrancy of life at the Jeongseon Arirang Market and the sound of the river flowing with the rail bike are like the rhythm of Arirang. Step on the rail bike pedals to follow Arirang's faults and ride a straw wire to Jeongseon, where you can embrace the Korean peninsula.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Journey starts at Auraji, the birthplace of Arirang. Auraji is named after Songcheon and Goljicheon. The two fabrics combine to form a river from the Auraji, the highest point of the Han River. Surrounded by mountains and boasting beautiful scenery, it is also the birthplace of Jeongseon Ari and love.

   In the story that came down, a loved one lived between the auraji. The two promised to go to Camellia to get the camellia, but they couldn't meet because the river couldn't get up because of heavy rain. It is said that longing and sadness, "Please hand over a ship of astronaut voyeur. All the camellia falls, and camellia falls. Fallen camellia piles up. On both ends of Goljicheon, there is a bridge that looks like a stone bridge on one side and a large crescent moon on one side.

   The Auraji is also the destination for selected rail bikes. The train stops due to the abandoned mine, and a three-car train carries locals and Jeongseon Sun stopped due to mismatch. This is where the rail bikes with tourist memories are stored. The starting point is Gujeolli Station. If you pedal hard to 7.2 km to the Aura area, you will arrive in less than an hour. Songcheon flows right next to the rail and it's not hot even if you pedal hard. It is popular because you can feel the nature of Jeongseon with your whole body.

   You can go through the tunnel where the train went, and when you cross the railroad crossing, you will hear a "beep" sound and you will be able to pass safely. It's almost downhill, so it's hard to get to the Aura region at 10-20km per hour.

   Byeongchi Chi-Skywalk is an observatory suspended from a cliff at 583 meters above sea level, which is twice the height of Yeouido 63 Building. It is a place where Donggang winds around the mountain and has a view of the night islands shaped like the Korean peninsula. It is made of transparent tempered glass, so you can enjoy the feeling of walking while floating on the scenery under your feet. Although tempered glass can be dangerous if people are too crowded, limit the number of people sent in. Wearing overshoes to protect the tempered glass from scratching, a cool breeze blows up when you climb the Skywalk. The village looks like far away from the Korean peninsula-shaped Bamseom. On the right side, you can hear the exciting shouts of those who descend on straw wires.
