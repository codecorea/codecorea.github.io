   The train bearing Jinju Station is a light line. It connects Gyeongsang-do and Jeolla-do, and became the 'Gyeongjeon Line' after the first letter. During the Japanese colonial period, rice and cotton were brought to Japan to connect Honam and Yeongnam granary and Busan. The earliest Gyeongjeon Line, which connected Jinju ~ Jeonju, Wonchon ~ Damyang, currently connects Samyangjin Station in Milyang, Gyeongnam and Songjeong Station in Gwangju. Jinju has long been a hub for inland traffic.

    If you look at the drama, you know that Jinju Station and Yeonhwado are very close, but there is actually quite a distance. It is about 60km by road from Jinju Station to Tongyeong Passenger Terminal. Where is it? It takes about 1 hour by boat from Tongyeong Passenger Terminal to reach Yeonhwa-do. It takes 55 minutes by car and about 1 hour and 10 minutes by public transport. To get to Tongyeong from Jinju, you have to travel from Jinju Station to Intercity Bus Terminal. Note that you can't board a Yeonhwado boat directly from Jinju Station. If you go to Jinju station after watching the drama, you should go to Intercity Bus Terminal again and go to Tongyeong Bus Terminal.
