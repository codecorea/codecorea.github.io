    There is also a taste for flower viewing. It is eager for anyone to have a leisurely walk, the comfort of sharing a mat and chatting.

   This is the dilemma of seeing spring flowers. I wish there were more flowers than people. Starting from the threshold of April, visitors to the country go all over the country in search of flower fragrance. When you enter the highway, it is time for more “○○ sightseeing” vehicles than ever before.

   In fact, when I say 'Maehwa in Namdo', the plum plantation in Daap-myeon, Gwangyang comes to mind at first glance. When it comes to plum blossoms, an average of 1 million people visit each year. Even if it blooms for 10 days, 100,000 people a day, if full bloom, 70,000 people a day would gather. They are more people than plum trees. Sumjin River, Jangdokdae, movie set, trails, delicious food… On the Daap-myeon in Gwangyang, there are many materials that attract visitors. It's time for the scattering of spring to see where the flowers are.

    If you've been obsessed with these worries once, how about going to Haenam? There is no Bohae plum plantation on the mountain side of Haenam, so it is rather a relaxing flower garden. 14,000 plum trees are planted in a field of 46,000 square meters, which is the largest in Korea. White plum blossoms are the main species, but intermittent red plum blossoms are also mixed. Camellia acts as a fence on both sides of the flower garden. Under the plum blossoms, it is a green meadow like a carpet. Wild flowers bloom in the meadow. When you sit on a mat, the whole area is plum, camellia, and wild flowers. By the morning of the weekday, you can take a full charge of the flower world. It is a natural flower garden with no artificial additions.

   Bohae Plum Farm, opened in 1978, is open to the public for free. The roof of the management office is open to the observation deck. The Plum Festival was held on March 16th and 17th this year, and the festival is noisy every year. Nanta performances, Pyongyang performing arts performances, Pungmul plaque performances, etc. are on the stage, and experience events such as plum face painting, kimchi making, and spring greens are included. Plum wine dipped with plums harvested directly from the plum farm is also sold.

   Bohae Plum Farm is not clearly standing along the main road. If there is no entry sign, it is easy to pass by. On the road, walking 1.8km across rice fields and fields reveals the farm. There are also small hermitages on the way, and the country house where the white dog barks must pass. By the time you encounter the landscape of plum blossoms in the yard of the house, you will notice that the farm is not far.

   Even before entering the central parking lot or the administrative office, it is a flower feast. You don't have to set a destination and go. Stop off the road and sit under the tree. Plum blossoms blooming here, Baekgahwa, Angsuk, Namgo, etc., but unfamiliar plums form a tunnel. The Maehwa Tunnel runs indefinitely to the north, south, and west. As you walk, laughter from your family pours from a corner, and in a distant corner, couples lie down with arms crossed. The red camellia that surrounds the flower garden is the end of the plum tunnel. The plum blossom garden on the back of the mountain was also the backdrop of the movie. I filmed a scene of a flowery spring day in &lt;You Are My Fate&gt; and &lt;Love Story&gt;.

   The plums harvested at the farms have different names depending on the processing method. Blue-green blue plum has a strong sour taste, and yellow ripe yellow plum has a good aroma. The smoked Omae peeled with Cheongmae is used as a medicinal herb, and pickled Cheongmae is dried in brine and is called Baekmae. Regardless of the name, plums are known to have excellent effects in helping fatigue and intestinal function. Besides plum wine, plum pickles, plum miso, etc. are definitely popular items near plum farms.

   To enjoy the plum farm more quietly, it is better to use public transportation. First of all, if you don't have enough parking space and don't like the sad scene of flowers getting tangled in the car, use the bus even more. There are eight free buses from Mokpo Terminal to Haenam-eup via Sanmyeon. The bus stops at the entrance of Plum Farm. There is Songcheon Bus Stop right next door, but when you get off at Songcheon, you must walk. At Mokpo Terminal, you must take a slow ride to Sanmyeon, not direct to Haenam. It takes about 50 minutes to Bohae Farm. From Haenam General Terminal, a bus bound for Sanmyeon and Mokpo takes about 20 minutes to Bohae Farm. Given that the last train from Haenam to Seoul is cut at 17:30, it is good to use Haenam-Bohae Farm-Mokpo section properly considering the time required for the bus. Unfortunately, there is no information on bones and flesh that are accessed through public transportation on the county offices, plum farms, and festival websites. It is hard to find even on blogs. It takes about 20 minutes to walk from the entrance to the flower garden with the signboard of the Bohae Farm, which is a good way.

   There were also many places to look around on the Haenam tour. It is recommended to visit the end of the village, Mihwangsa Temple, and Uhangri Dinosaur Fossil. Mihwangsa Temple is cozy at dawn, and the sunrise and sunset can be seen from the ground observatory.
