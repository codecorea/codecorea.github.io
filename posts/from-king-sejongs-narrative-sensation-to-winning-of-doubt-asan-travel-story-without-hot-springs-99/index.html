   But it's Onyang. First of all, in ‘ruff shinjab’ style Who was named Onyang? Onyang people say it is King Sejong the Great. This is because King Sejong the Great went to Onyang-gun after he found Onyang-gun therapeutic car. The trace of King Sejong's visit to Onyang is cultural property data # 314 Onyang Fish Euijeongjeong (溫陽 御醫 井). Euijeongjeong is on the way to Onyang Middle School.

   There is also a young band that appeared in &lt;Red Goddess 2&gt;. Jang Hun-se-ja (aposto-the-ce-ce-ja), who was later deemed a major, found his father Yeong-jo and Onyang, and bowed his martial arts. To commemorate this, three zelkova trees were planted. Later, King Jeongjo built a stand in honor of his father, Jang Hun Sei, and wrote in his own words, Youngdae. Why did you use a picture tree bull when it was zelkova? When the ancestors refer to zelkova, they used the same one.

   Back to the origin! The Ark Church and the Museum of Water, Wind, and Stone are essential courses for Jeju travel. It is the work of Itami Jun (Korean name Lee Dong Ryong) along with Jeju Grape Hotel. He is a well-known architect who has won the Chevalier Prize of Best Art and Culture of France. But his first building is in Onyang. About 20 years ahead of the grape hotel.

   The exhibition is a structure coming out to see the underground 4D movie theater on the first floor. One interesting fact. The architect originally planned to arrange General Yi Soon Shin's &lt;Diary Diary&gt; in the 4D movie theater as the final exhibition. It is a system that reads the diary of the same day as the date of reality. Unfortunately, it changed in the process of building. The Diary Diary is in the exhibition room on the first floor.

   If you are curious about Asan in &lt;Aldish Sinjab2&gt; besides Young Daedae? We recommend Jang Young-sil Science Museum and Asan Mediterranean Village. Jang Young-Shil Science Museum delivers it as an experience rather than a text, as shown in &lt;Aldsin Shinjab2&gt;. For example, “In the toilet of my house,” the ball was put in a large set of toilets instead of particles of water and decorated like a playground. Children experience the siphon principle in secret. 'Start! Similarly, it is similar to 'Frimride' or 'Let the train tracks'. Become familiar with science as children play.

Adults are encouraged to visit the Asan Green Tower Observatory, 150 meters high, connected to the Asan Ecological Insect. Above the observation deck are cafes and restaurants. Enjoy a meal or coffee while looking down at Asan city. Actually, Jang Young-sil Science Museum and Asan Ecological Insect Garden are sewage treatment plant and waste incinerator. It is also called Asan Environmental Science Park. Of course, environmental pollution control facilities are applied.

   The exhibition hall consists of an exhibition room on the first floor and a sunset cafe on the second floor. The showroom has a lot of Korean comedy history. Look for a familiar gagman by generation. The second floor was a wild field outside the west with a window, so the view was wide. After the show, you will have a cup of coffee and wait for the sunset. In front of the comedy hall was a railroad track. Now it is the section where Asan Rail Bike comes and goes. It operates in December in a circular fashion. Comedy Hall is 2.5 km from Dogo Onsen Station. It forms a triangle with the same distance as Paradise Spadogo. Traveling on public transport is also suitable for families and lovers on a train.
