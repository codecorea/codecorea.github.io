   Song Kang Chungcheol expressed how beautiful he was in the Kwandong Byeonggok with the expression 'Everything's around the Gangneung' Gangmungyo '(currently the bridge) in the 16th century. The indigo sea behind the signboard with this phrase is where Sung Joon began to feel sweet emotions for Hyejin for the first time. Gangmun Beach, located south of Gangmun Bridge, is the beach that filled the hearts of many people like her smiling in the camera frame taken for the magazine photo shoot.

   Located next to Gyeongpo Beach, this place is small and quiet unlike Gyeongpo Beach, so it is the best place to think alone. This place is perfect for `` traveling alone. '' The beautiful structures I saw in the drama are also sparse, so it's good to take a picture with your lover or a friend and leave memories. If you are planning to stay overnight, check out the night Gangmun Beach. The night view of the sodary bridge connecting Gangmun beach and Gyeongpo beach is excellent.
