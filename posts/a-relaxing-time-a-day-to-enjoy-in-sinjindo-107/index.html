   Winter beach on the way to Sinjindo Port
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The journey of winter day to Sinjindo by 603 local road in Taean-eup is a great trip. There's no special place, and it's been a long time since the bustle of the port has passed since the Chukumina and Blue Crabs. At the very least, only buses with anglers head to Xinjin. But the winter sea is a pleasure to enjoy. On the way to Sinjindo, there is a beach showing the essence of the winter sea. Yeonpo Beach and Maneul Beach. This is a place to stop by on your way to Sinjindo.

   Yeonpo Beach is the first place to meet. Sol Island, with its pine trees growing in the middle of the beach and the sea, is eye-catching. It is also unique as it is a beach facing south from the west coast. The beach spreads out right after the pine forest. Yeonpo Beach is a place where you can watch the sunrise and the Sunrise Festival is held on January 1 every year. When the sun rises over the low mountains of the Taean Peninsula, Solseom, which floats in the middle of the sea, adds to the flavor.

   About 6 km away from Yeonpo Beach, Gaeulyi Beach can also be found on the way to Sinjindo Port. The beach is impressive with fine white sand. The sand is piled up at the entrance of the beach, and the sand is blown away like a desert, but when it is on the beach, the fine sand hardens to form a soft white sand. At low tide, traces of crabs, shellfish, etc. have been drawn over the beach like a picture. Mane Beach has been restricted to civilian access to military areas since the late 1970s. Civilian access was then made possible in the late 1990s.

   Mangae Beach became famous as it was known as a filming location. In the movie &lt;Bungy Jump&gt; starring Lee Byung-hun and Lee Eun-ju, a film was shot here where a male and female protagonist danced to Waltz No. 2 in Shostakovich's Suite for Jazz Orchestra. The dance and music of the two people, which were spread between the silhouettes of the pine trees and the pine trees that stained the beach, are still new in memory. In addition to the dramas such as Dragon Tears, Yeocheon-cheon, and The Man of Princess, Gwae-ri Beach has appeared.

   Enjoy Sinjindo Port after Anheung Port

  <div class="txt_p">
   After exiting the beach, take the 603 local road, which is divided into the road to Anheung Port and the road to Sinjindo across Sinjin Bridge. Anheungseong, where the two roads are divided, is worth a visit. Anheungseong, located at the end of the Taean Peninsula extending southwest, is a castle built during the late Hyojong period in the late Joseon Dynasty. Only the west gate, now called the "Su Hong Ru," remains, and the castle runs along the northern slope. Built on the back mountain of Anheung Port, it was a strategic point of view overlooking the coast and a path through which the Chosun Ship passed. Beyond Anheungseong is Anheung Port, which was once a big port. Since Sinjindo Port was designated as the first national fishing port in the 1970s, it has become a quiet port where fishing boats and small fishing boats only travel. The port landscape as if time has stopped is lonely.

   Crossing Sinjin Bridge leads to Sinjindo, which doesn't feel like an island. Although the exact story is not told, Sinjindo was originally land connected with Anheung Port, and it was called Sinjindo as a new naruto that became an island. It is a long way from Sinjin Bridge to Sinjindo Port adjacent to the sea. Along the well-appointed road, accommodations and restaurants are side-by-side, and the breakwater extends to both sides as if the arms were wrapped in front of the harbor. The breakwater with the red lighthouse is connected to the island called Bueokdo, and the breakwater with the white lighthouse is connected to the island called Mador. From Sinjindo Port, cruise ships returning from Gaido and Jung Jeong-do and cruise ships leaving Ongdo 12 km away.

The flight schedule may change according to the weather, so it is recommended to inquire in advance (Xinjin Anheung Cruise 041-675-1603).

   Care is taken to trim the crab so that the crabmeat retains its original form. Thanks to it, it doesn't taste fishy or gritty at all. This is a salty soy crab with the original taste of crabs. It is soft and light because it does not contain seasonings and preservatives. Even though the price is expensive, the side dishes don't come out so I feel like I'm treated properly.

   In winter, the sunset from the Mado breakwater is spectacular. Mado Sea is a place where many underwater relics have been excavated, so called 'underwater racing'. In the Chosun Dynasty, Maundo Line 4 was excavated, and in 2007, more than 25,000 artifacts have been excavated since Jukumi picked up the treats of Goryeo celadon from Jukdo near Sinjindo Port. The sea area of Mado was the path of Choun-sun Line from Jeolla-do since the Goryeo Dynasty. It was also an international port where trade ships with the Song Dynasty entered during the Goryeo Dynasty and Chinese messengers entered the Joseon Dynasty. However, the tide of the tide was big and the tide was fast, the vessels were frequent accidents. Therefore, this sea area was called the “hard track” because it is a difficult sea road, and since then, it is called “Anheung-yang” in the hope of calming the boat.

   Mado, a treasure island, can be easily reached from Sinjindo Port along Mado-gil to a landing bridge. As soon as you pass the Ritz-Carsley Resort, follow the road to the right for about 1km until you reach Madoka Breakwater. Mado breakwaters are famous for fishing spots and are lined with anglers on weekdays. Especially mackerel and mackerel are caught well, so you can easily enjoy fishing if you buy simple equipment from nearby shops. In winter, the sunset that falls from the Madeo Breakwater to the West Sea is spectacular. The sea begins to glow golden at about 4:30 pm when the sun begins to lean slowly. It is also spectacular to see fishing boats rushing to the port after finishing the operation. It is especially beautiful when fishing boats pass on the golden waterway that runs in line with the sun. The sun slowly falls to the south of Gaido, west of the village.
