    Maybe not. I am curious in this passage. Why Suncheon Bay?
   </p>
   <p>
    First, let's start with the location of Suncheon Bay. Boseong Beolgyo in the west and Gwangyang in the east, and Suncheon, located between them, directly touch the South Sea. Thanks to the Goheung Peninsula below Boseong and the Yeosu Peninsula below Gwangyang, Suncheon has “Suncheon Bay” on both sides. Suncheon, which has both Goheung and Gobaekho Gwangyang on the left, gained only the Namhae and Suncheon bays that are stable to look at. At the end of Namdo Island, Suncheon also has fresh water stems that touch the sea. The streams of the valley gathered to form a river, and the rivers continued to go out to sea. In the space where fresh water meets salty water, where the two are mixed, more diverse stories are born. Only Suncheon belongs here.

   Beautiful scenery, a living story in it
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Even if you haven't seen the real thing, it will be nice to say 'Ah, here!' In addition to the beautiful scenery depicted by the tidal flats and reeds, numerous creatures breathing in it greet people. In other words, “Suncheonman” itself is a huge garden. How about looking at a natural garden, not a man-made garden, but a space that embraces the naturally created ecology itself?
    <br/>
    It is regarded as one of the world's five coastal wetlands, as well as a shelter for migratory birds and a habitat for plants. The Suncheon Bay, a treasure trove of ecosystems, has emerged in an ecological environment of Suncheon Bay as more and more people seek it. That is why the Suncheon Bay International Garden Expo was born.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    The International Garden Expo in Suncheon Bay, a natural garden. Where to start. Anywhere is good, so once you find Suncheon, don't miss both spaces. Comparing a garden created by nature with a man-made garden is also a bigger study than I thought. Before starting a full-scale ecological tour, let's take a look at the fair. The exhibition hall, which has the theme of “Garden of the Earth,” has 80 gardens in 23 countries including Korea. Various gardens and colorful flowers greet people. The eyes are strong just by looking. In addition, it serves as an 'Eco-belt' that protects only Suncheon. The Suncheon Bay International Garden Expo is another special reason.

    First, let's go to the Suncheon Bay International Garden Expo. If you look at the map, you can see that the natural wetland belongs to it. The fairground is wider than expected. Instead of expecting to go to see the flowers in a cute way, accepting them as a visit to gardens around the world will help you move around the field. Looking at the map, a large space is divided into the west and east with the ‘dream bridge’ in the middle. Dongcheon, flowing under the bridge of dreams connecting the two, joins the Namhae through Daedaepo-gu, Suncheon Bay, which is also the actual background of &lt;Moojin Travel&gt;. After visiting the fairground, we will climb the Yongsan Observatory at Suncheon Bay Ecological Park to see the scene of the Dongcheon stems infiltrating the South Sea at sunset. The beautiful Suncheon Bay sunset is a bonus. To do this, you must leave the fairground at 5:30.

    With this in mind, planning a tour of the fairground can help in many ways. The fairground is largely divided into four areas. To the west of the Bridge of Dreams is the ① Arboretum Area, to which the Korean Garden and Azalea Garden belong, and the ② Wetland Center Area, to which Suncheon Bay International Wetland Center and Sky Garden are located. To the east of the Bridge of Dreams is the Garden of the Mugunghwa and the Rose Garden of the Beast, as well as gardens from around the world, including China, Japan, France, the Netherlands, the United States, and Spain. As you might have noticed, you can put your dream bridge in the center and look at it one by one. There is also a west gate parking lot in the west and an east gate parking lot in the east.

   <p>
    The Suncheon Bay International Garden Expo introduces various courses, including by type and time. If you look at it before travelling, it will be very helpful to visit the fair. The space is probably wide, so I look for more traffic lines to search by time. The shortest 2-hour course is a crossing that looks at only one of the west and east sections without crossing the bridge of dreams. If you stop by for a short time or purchase a night pass, this is not a bad way to see.

  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    For a moment, let's look at the night pass. Until August 31, the Suncheon Bay International Garden Expo will be open until 9 PM. In addition to this period, the fair night ticket, which is open from 5 pm, is also sold. It can be used at half the price of a one-day pass (16,000 won for adults, 12,000 won for teenagers, 8,000 won for children), so you can enjoy the fair at a reasonable price. However, there are areas that cannot be viewed for safety reasons, such as the Korean Lake Garden, the Azalea Garden, and some foreign gardens after 7 pm. If you don't want to miss them, there is a way to see them first at 5pm, where you can enter with a night pass.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Buying a 2-day pass is fine if you bring your children to vacation. 24,000 won for adults, 18,000 won for teenagers, and 12,000 won for children. Even if you visit with your parents, it may be a little unreasonable to look around at once. This is because it takes at least 5 hours to inspect the fair. It can be unreasonable for young children or seniors on a hot summer day. It is necessary to have a leisurely viewing that does not endure in time.

    It's also a good way to make your own route at a fixed time. Don't miss the South Korea Garden and Arboretum Observation Deck, the Eco Geo Greenhouse and Suncheon Bay International Wetland Center. In particular, the Suncheon Bay International Wetland Center, the theme hall of the exhibition, is helpful for the overall understanding if you look at the exhibition tour first. It may be a good idea to look at the finish, but there are some cases where you can't afford to look after it. Also, let's not forget the view of the arboretum with the fairground at a glance.

    If you're in the west, go to the bridge of dreams. The bridge of dreams created by collecting pictures from children from around the world was designed by artist Garimmak and installation artist Kang Ik-jung of Gwanghwamun. When you cross the bridge, gardens from all over the world are opened in earnest. There are Dutch gardens of tulips and windmills, French gardens overlooking the Palace of Versailles, another familiar Chinese garden, and Japanese gardens filled with delicate emotions. The Rose Garden of the Beast and Maze Garden of the Black Crane are not to be missed.

    Fortunately, there is a circular bus every 5 minutes in the East of Dream Bridge and in the World Garden area. It is an eco-friendly bus that is charged with electricity, making it popular with children as well as seniors. There is a place to rest in the middle, so let's enjoy it slowly and leisurely. The point of Suncheon Bay International Garden Expo is to enjoy nature naturally and leisurely. After visiting the fair, don't forget to take a look at Suncheon Bay at the Natural Ecological Park. Human beings simply admire the nature as it is. Should we make this beautiful scene visible to our children? Traveling in Suncheon Bay will be enriched by just thinking about nature.
