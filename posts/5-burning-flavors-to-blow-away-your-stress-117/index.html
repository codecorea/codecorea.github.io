   #One. Singil-dong Spicy Champon
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    The spicy taste of Seoul, the best champon restaurant that comes to mind when you first think of it.
    <br/>
    Originally, the food itself has a spicy taste. Among them, spicy is one of the nation's wards, so be prepared. No matter how urgently the champon is, you should prepare a drink that will soothe the extreme spiciness.
    <br/>
    When you enter the store, there is a warning saying 'Please don't try Wanpong'. 'Empty, pregnant women, senior citizens, high blood pressure, gastritis, gastric ulcers, bad condition champon absolute envoy' is added. I want to try spicy jjamppong. The appearance is not much different from the champon I've seen so far. Suffering, the pain begins as soon as you take the broth and take it to your mouth. It's spicy and spicy. But my hand keeps going. It is the same as those who ate champon with tears and runny noses. Not much seafood, but good for the price. It's hard, but it's spicy when I turn around. When it's complicated, it disappears as soon as it finds it. It's better to remember the hot soup season. However, be sure to include udon or gimbap for our stomach. We are precious.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Enjoy pork cutlet for all ages. To what extent can you think of the spicy taste of pork cutlet that is perfect for a weekend family outing? The champon, jokbal, chicken feet, and tteokbokki that are introduced as `` Seoul spicy '' are spicy in the seasoning itself, so it is not difficult to imagine the spicy taste. On the other hand, the cutlet taste is only remembered, but the spicy taste is not well associated. This prejudice (?) Disappears naturally when you look for 'Honjeong Dongas', which is famous for its spicy pork cuts near the Sindaebang Intersection.
