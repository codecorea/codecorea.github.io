    Just a few years ago, Pangyo was just a restricted area of outskirts of Seongnam or Gyeongbu Expressway. The development of a new city led to the construction of a large-scale apartment complex and many IT companies nesting in Pangyo Techno Valley have now become the most modern city.

   <p>
    Pangyo Museum is a place where exhibits of relics and ruins discovered during the construction of Pangyo New Town show the long history of Pangyo. In the process of cultural property research conducted prior to the development of the housing site, nine ancient tombs of Hanseong Baekje era, two ancient Goguryeo tombs in Sampyeong-dong, the Goryeo period and Cheongja, and the white porcelain period were discovered. A museum was built in the area where Baekje burial mounds were mainly excavated and opened in the winter of 2013.

   It's a single-story building from the outside, but when you enter, it's one floor above the ground, but you'll be surprised because it's several times deeper. As a museum that mainly displays burial mounds, the entire building is concentrated under the ground.
