    When Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi-do, what do people think of first? U.S. forces? Bag stew? There may be people who think of Pyongyang Myeonok, Uijeongbu, which is the 'original house' of Euljimyeonok and Pildongmyeonok in Seoul. However, the symbol that really represents Uijeongbu is in the square opposite Uijeongbu Station. This is 'Taejo Lee Seong-gye' in the form of shooting an arrow on a horse. What is the relationship between Uijeongbu and Lee Seong-gye? From now on, let's go around every corner of Uijeongbu to see them.

   Why Uijeongbu City was called Uijeongbu
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The statue of Lee Seong-gye, located in Hwangno-ro Square in Uijeongbu City, is the symbol of Uijeongbu for the first time to welcome visitors from Uijeongbu Station. The relationship between Uijeongbu City and Lee Seong-gye dates back to the Prince's death. Taejo, who loses his son and loses his throne due to the prince's difficulties, goes to Hamhung, his hometown. At this time, the Hamheung chasers who went to visit Taejo became 'Hamheungchasa' as it was, and an ancient vocabulary called 'Hamheungchasa' was created (the legend that Taejo killed Hamheungchas is not true).

   Taejo, who returned from Hamheung after a twist, was said to have stayed near Howon-dong, Uijeongbu, before going to Hanyang. In order to greet Taejo, Jeongseung came to Uijeongbu, and the name of this place became Uijeongbu because they discussed national affairs here. Uijeongbu was the name of the city of Uijeongbu and was a kind of the State Council where the Joseon Dynasty priests discussed the state.

   The second destination of the ‘Uijeongbu Journey to Seek the Seonggye’ is the second destination of Hoeryong Temple. The first time that Hoeryongsa Temple at the foot of Dobongsan, which spans Seoul and Uijeongbu, opened its doors around King Silla. At the time of its founding, it was said to have been named Beopseongsa Temple, but it was changed to Hoeryongsa Temple by establishing a relationship with Seongggye Lee. At the end of the Goryeo Dynasty, Ambassador Muhak, who advocated Hoeryongsa Temple, stayed with Lee Seong-gye, who was still the general's status, and offered a ball of fire.

   A little different story is written in Horyongsa Temple in the midst of King Gojong.

I don't know exactly what is true, but it seems certain that this place is deeply related to Taejo Lee Seong-gye.

   Yangju is the final course of the ‘Uijeongbu Journey in Search of Lee Seong-Gye’. In Hoeju, right next to Uijeongbu, there was Hoamsa Temple, the capital of the city. However, only Hoeamsa Temple remains in the area. Hoamsa Temple, which was built before Goryeo and emerged as the largest temple in the Joseon Dynasty, burned down as the anti-billion policy was strengthened since the middle of Chosun. Then you don't have to worry about what to see. This is because you can vividly see the state of the time through artifacts and various exhibits at the Hoamsaji Museum, the latest facility built two years ago.

   It was said that the founding of Hoeamsa Temple was 15 years (1328) of King Chung Sook of Goryeo. It is said that the Indian monk Jigong, who came to Goryeo through the Won Dynasty at this time, built Hoeamsa Temple. However, it is presumed that there was already another temple in this place, noting that it was a midsole rather than an opening. After that, the Ambassador of Muhak stayed here, and it was said that Taejo, who had been injured by the prince's difficulties, came to this place and received a law from Muhak and lived a religious life.

   Secret of Blue Tiles in Hoeamsa Temple

  <div class="txt_p">
   The most eye-catching artifact from Hoeamsaji Museum is Cheonggi. Cheonggi was popular in the Ming Dynasty of China, and it was baked with a glaze on flat tiles. Of course, the production cost was higher than that of a flat tile, and it was not easy to use in the royal family. The appearance of such a flag indicates that Hoamsa Temple was fully supported by the royal family. In addition, a number of exquisite waters, dragon heads, and phoenix-patterned tiles were found in the palace architecture.

   In fact, Hoamsa Temple has been supported by the royal family since the Goryeo Dynasty. The same was true of Joseon Taejo, who spared Hoamsa Temple. In the Joseon Dynasty Annals, there are several records that Taejo lowered grain in Hoeamsa Temple and offered monks. Hoeamsa Temple, which had enjoyed its peak due to the Buddhist preferential policies of King Munjeong, who had been the father of the middle class since the reign of King Taejo, burned up with her death, not exceeding the violent waves of the billion dollar policy.
