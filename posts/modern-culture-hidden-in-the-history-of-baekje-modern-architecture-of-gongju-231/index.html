    People's preconceptions are terrifying. If you have a fixed perspective on one thing or thing, you don't think well in other ways. The same goes for people's thoughts about princesses. Because it is well-known as the capital of Baekje, only the ruins of Baekje, such as the Royal Mausoleum of King Muryeong and the communist castle, are thought of, but do not think about the remains of other times. In Gongju, there are artifacts and remains of each period, from prehistoric cultural relics prior to the Three Kingdoms period to Goryeo and Joseon. Nevertheless, people are not interested in these ruins, so they may be victims of Baekje history.

  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The starting point for the modern architecture of Gongju is Seonhwadang. On the right side of the National Princess Museum, you can see the Palace of Archery and the Sunhwadang is opposite. Seonhwa (宣化) means 'to reveal the virtue of the king and spread it widely and edify the people'. The Seonhwadang, which has an impressive lawn, is where the Chungcheong-do observer watched the affairs. Today, it is a metropolitan city that covers Daejeon and Chungcheong-do. During the Joseon Dynasty, Chungcheong Gamyeong was a local base in the Hoseo region, which shoulders Yeonghonam. At the time of its creation, it was 9 squares on the front and 5 squares on the side, but now it has been reduced to 8 squares on the front and 4 squares on the side. It was used as a display for the old National Princess Museum in 1937, and then moved to its present location when the museum moved in 1992.

   The pavilion on the second floor seen from the front is Pojeongsa, the main gate of the Sunhwa Party. The lower floor was used as a doorway with a large door, and the upper floor was used as a pavilion. Until the Japanese colonial rule, it was used as the main gate of the Gongjusadaebugo. As you climb the pavilion, you can see the pine garden and Sunhwadang at a glance. The building lined up between Sunhwadang and Pojeongsa is Dongheon. This is the place where the observer tried the trial after seeing administrative affairs. The unpretentious elegance blends with the pine gardens on both sides.

   The second course, the old Gongju-eup office, is impressive with red bricks. It looks like a matchbox, so it can be seen that it is a modern building even at a glance. This building was where Gongju was in charge of administration in the process of transitioning from the center of local administration to the educational city. It is a space that shows the biggest change of the princess.

   Since it was founded as the Chungnam Financial Association Federation Hall in 1920, the Gongju-eup Office and Gongju were promoted to Poems from 1930 to 1985, and were used as city halls. As it is currently under construction, it is impressive that the surroundings are cluttered and the four circular pillars visible in the front and the circular windows are arranged symmetrically. The arched entrance, reminiscent of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, is said to be typical of classical architecture. After the construction of a citizen's shelter behind the building, the construction seems to be a great history education ground.

   Walk about 10 minutes from the old Gongju-eup office to the back of Bonghwan-dong and you can meet the Gothic Gongju First Church. It is sandwiched between modern buildings, but it doesn't look very old, but it was the first Methodist church in the southern part built in 1930 with red brick. During the Korean War, it was damaged a lot, but the walls and chimneys have been preserved, and there are traces of time. The building year is marked on the wall of the building. Under the spire, the letters engraved as 'worship party' are strange, but the feeling goes up.

   If you turn your foot to the highest point in the country, you will see the Middle East Cathedral with Gothic bell tower. It was the French missionary Jean Peter, who preached Catholicism to the princess. The cathedral building was completed in 1936 by Father Choi Jong-cheol, who served as the head of the church in 1921, designed a model of Seoul's Yakhyeon Cathedral. The cathedral, priests, and convent were held on May 12 of the following year, but only the main hall and priests remain.

   The main hall follows the Gothic style that was popular in the Middle East and West. The red bricks were carefully raised one by one, and the entrances and windows of the entrance were decorated with arches, emphasizing the vertical elements while adding softness. It seems somewhat dark when entering the room, but the light coming through the vitrification (stained glass) creates a sacred atmosphere. It is as if the world outside the cathedral is separated from the inside. Because of this vitrification, the interior of the cathedral may be a sacred and noble place.

   What stands out is not just vitrification. The pillars of stone are also colorful. The stone pillars sculpted in an octagon facing each other side to side give an exotic feeling that cannot be seen in traditional wooden structures. The Priest Building is a two-story building that is well-symmetrical. As Catholicism entered the inland of Chungcheong-do through the west coast, a modern cathedral was built, and the Middle East Cathedral is one of them, yet has a classical beauty.

   The Chungcheongnam-do History Museum facing the Middle East Cathedral and a road is also indispensable. The old trees in the yard are in harmony with the red brick building, giving a feeling of old. It is a building that adds traditional elements to modern architecture. In 1971, it was used as a National Princess Museum to collect and display artifacts excavated from Songsan-ri Ancient Tombs, and now it is used as a Chungcheongnam-do History Museum. The museum exhibits historical materials and folklore items from the Joseon Dynasty to the modern era, as well as the relics of Yoon Jeung and Yun Jeung-ga, the leaders of Soron in the Joseon Dynasty.

   Walking along the side street of the History Museum, you can see Yeongmyeong Middle and High School. There is a three-story house on the hill behind the school. This house overlooking the city of Gongju is a missionary house. In 1921, American missionary Sharp and his wife, Sharp Alice (Korean name Saarishi), lived there. Perhaps because of the exclusion of a Korean citizen, he was unable to build a house near the village and built a house on a hill far away. Still, it is a symbolic place that took root in modern education during the gloomy Japanese occupation. Saarisi founded the modern school Myeongseon Women's School in Gongju in 1905. The missionary house was also used as a dormitory for Kongju National University of Education. Currently, it is a privately owned house, so you cannot see inside.

   The final answer to the modern architecture trip is the Geumgang Steel Bridge next to Communist Castle. The first bridge across the Geumgang of Gongju was “Dongguchunnung”, a bridge that was installed only in winter. In 1984, the Japanese made a public road leading to Jochiwon and Cheongju by connecting the bridges, making the way for the Japanese-Japanese War. Subsequently, for the convenience of colonial policy, the Japanese government moved the location of the metropolitan government to the place where the railway passes. Public opinion about the relocation of the Chungnam Provincial Office was raised by Japanese residents in Daejeon since 1910. In November 1930, when the relocation of the city hall became visible, people in the Gongju area campaigned against it. In response to this, Daejeon and Cheonan areas launched a campaign to attract metropolitan government. At the time, the newspaper even commented, "The five men are arguing over one pretty parasite."

   In 1931, the Chungnam Provincial Government's relocation to Daejeon was finalized, and the following year, the provincial government moved from Gongju to Daejeon. The Governor-General of Korea opened a new route between Gongju and Daejeon and constructed the Geumgang Steel Bridge in order to prevent the opposition of the citizens of Gongju following the relocation of the government. At that time, the Geumgang Railway Bridge was called the “Longest Bridge in the South of the Han River,” and the Gongju area became an opportunity to develop into a transportation hub.
