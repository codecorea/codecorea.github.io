    As soon as you enter the front door of the Japan Meteorological Agency, you can see the right and left sides. In 1441, during the time of King Sejong in Joseon, a rain gauge to measure rainfall was invented. Previously, it was said to measure the depth of rainwater that had penetrated the ground with a homina plow. The rain gauge displayed on the porch of the Korea Meteorological Administration is a reproduction of the gold rain gauge (treasure No. 561), which was produced in 1837 and used in Gongyeong Gamyeong (Geumyeong). The authentic product was taken out to the Japan Meteorological Agency during the Japanese colonial rule, and was returned in 1971. It is divided into three stages, and it is a bamboo ruler called ‘Jukcheok’.
    <br/>
    The sideband refers to the side stand. There are two exhibits on the porch, one of which is the Gwanwoodae (Treasure No. 843), which was in a sense of contemplation. Gwansanggam is the government office in charge of astronomical, geographic, and posthumous affairs in the Joseon Dynasty.
    <br/>
    Large pictures of Sejong's servants and their raindrops on the side of the raincoat and the raincoat catch the visitors' attention. The spirit of Sejong's love for the people seems to be transmitted vividly in the 21st century.

    The Meteorological Agency experience learning is conducted in the order of watching the Meteorological Agency video, drawing a weather map, visiting observation equipment, experiencing weather casters, and exploring outdoor observation equipment. On the first day of each month, you can apply for experiential learning for the next month. Individual experiences are held every Wednesday, and group experiences are held every Thursday and Friday. Online reservations are only available through the Japan Meteorological Agency website. The duration of the experience is about 2 hours.
    <br/>
    First, we gather in the auditorium to find out what the Korea Meteorological Administration is doing through animation. Cartoon protagonists tell the process of weather forecasting without boring. It is conducted in the order of current weather identification, data collection, analysis, forecasting, and notification. Of course, a detailed explanation of each process follows. Also, find out the meaning of the sign that appears in the weather map. The parents who accompanied the children also miss a word and focus on their mind.

    The symbols in the weather map have their own meaning. It means the amount of clouds, the direction of the wind, the speed of the wind, the current weather, and air pressure. In the final stage of drawing the weather map, it is necessary to complete the shape of air pressure bones such as low pressure and high pressure.
    <br/>
    I need to know common sense about air pressure. The force that the air surrounding the Earth presses down by gravity is called air pressure. It is Italian physicist Torricelli who expresses the pressure in numbers. He experimented with filling a 1m glass tube with one end clogged with mercury and standing upside down in a mercury container. At this time, it was determined that one mercury column corresponds to a height of about 760 mm. The unit of air pressure is hectopascal (hPa).

    After watching the video for about an hour, the children try to draw a diary. In the old days, it was unpredictable to see rain or drought. So, when there was a severe drought, even the king went out and stayed in the sky. How is it today? In order to protect people's lives and property, the Korea Meteorological Administration provides all kinds of scientific equipment such as supercomputers and meteorological satellites to provide weather information, typhoon information, and weather information. Also, in order to support the people's life and industrial activities, they regularly give out local and weekly forecasts, long-term forecasts, and even mountain and airport weather.
    <br/>
    Weather forecasting is to grasp the change of weather from the past to the present and use it to predict how the weather in the future will change. Observe air temperature, air pressure, wind, humidity, precipitation, and clouds in a variety of ways, including automatic weather observation equipment, satellites, radar, ships, and aircraft. It analyzes the data collected not only in Korea but also around the world and draws a weather map. Based on this weather map, experienced weather forecasters deliver comprehensive weather forecasts to the public.
    <br/>
    Weather forecasting has a great impact on our lives, our environment, and our industry. If you have a rain forecast, you can pack an umbrella when you leave the house. When the weather forecast that the sun will be bright will come out, the car wash is full. At industrial sites, we listen very closely to weather forecasts. Depending on the weather forecast for the upcoming season, you will be making a lot of winter clothes, increasing the production of air conditioning appliances, or adjusting the production of ice cream.

    After drawing the weather map, we go around the 2nd and 3rd floors, meet various observation equipment, and look around the weather station on the 1st floor. A large Donggwoldo Island hangs outside the weather station. You may be wondering, 'Which Donggwol in the Meteorological Office?' It is a document that proves. It is a passage that shows how deeply interested the kings and servants of Joseon were in the weather.
    <br/>
    Back in Hyundai, you too have time to become a weather caster. Even though it is not a broadcasting station, I enter the studio and stand in front of the TV camera. I'm a weather caster today! In the news, just as the weather caster forecasts the weather, the experienced customers can confidently deliver the weather of tomorrow by looking at the weather map.

    Finally, we move to an outdoor observation site packed with weather observation equipment. On one side of the lawn, rainwater, wind, and anbuil are gathered. The Punggidae here is a replica of the Punggidae of Changgyeonggung Palace and is a stand to build the punggi. The Punggidae was built in the main palaces and observatory until the early 18th century. Currently, there are Punggidae, Changgyeonggung Palace and Punggidae, Gyeongbokgung Palace. The wind direction was determined and the wind speed was judged by waving the flag.
    <br/>
    The white white leaf image, which was thought to be the pronoun of the Korea Meteorological Administration, remains on the observation site. If you open the door and look inside, there is a high temperature thermometer, a low temperature thermometer, and an Asman ventilation and humidity system. However, we no longer forecast the weather through Baek Yeop-sang. A variety of weather information is collected with an automatic weather system built next to a white leaf.
