   Even in the Jeongseon Valley, there is a beautiful scenery hidden in the remote areas of the mountain that needs to go further north. The Gumijeong Valley is said to have nine kinds of beauty.

   After retiring from the official office during the reign of King Sukjong of Joseon, Lee Ja-ja left a sperm called Gumi-jeong. While setting up a pavilion, he named nine of the surrounding scenery as “Gumi”. The first is ‘어량 (漁梁)’. Refers to a landscape where a fish is placed on the water when a fish bounces to go upstream. Next, 'Jeonju' pointing to the hillside, 'Banseo', a large, flat and large stone, 'Stands', a small pond on the rock behind Gumijeong, 'Pyeongam', a large and large rock, 'Pyongam', a calm pond between rocks ',' Chwibyeok ', which points to the blue scenery of the shelter between the stone walls in front of Gumijeong, and' Yeolsu ', which refers to holes in the cliffs around Gumijeong and rocks of strange shapes, are the nine beauty.

    The pavilion built in this landscape is Gumijeong. There is Gumijeong, so this valley became the Gumijeong Valley. Sit in the pavilion to cool the sweat in the breeze. Gumijeong was located on a rock over the valley. Even across the valley in front of Gumijeong, dozens of meters of cliffs (cliffs) stand in the sky. The scenery surrounding the sperm is unfamiliar because it is not ripe for the eyes.

   Saeulgi Village where you can see the Gumijeong Valley at a glance
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   It is good to enjoy nine different scenery of Gumijeong in Jeongja and Valley, but what if you can capture the beauty at a glance? To see the scenery of Gumijeong Valley at a glance, you need to go to Saeulgi Village, about 2km by car from Gumijeong. Saeulgi Village was located on a stand in front of Gumijeong.
   <br/>
   Depart from Gumijeong and leave Gumijeong Valley on the left and go a little and a bridge comes out. Crossing the bridge and going uphill is Saeulgi Village. The scenery of the village at a glance is warm and peaceful. The hillsides, the paths between them, the sparsely nestled homes, and the roads connecting the houses, all of these scenery make the traveler's mind comfortable.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Few households live in Saulgi village. It was said that there was a temple in this place a long time ago, and there were many birds in the forest where the temple was located.
   <br/>
   I asked the villagers on the road to go to ‘Hmukdaedae’. Hmukdaedae is a view that overlooks the landscape of Gumijeong. As the residents instructed, they walked through the forest road for 1 ~ 2 minutes and came out.

   Gumijeong and Goljicheon scenery can be seen at a glance below the cliffs of several tens of meters. Sunny at the end of a cliff When he approaches carefully, he stands on a rock at the end of a dazzling cliff and takes in a beautiful scenery. The blue water flows around the Gumijeong Valley, which is full of rock formations. Someone's house is behind the road across the valley, and a field spreads out in front of it. Sit for a long time at the edge of a cliff and lose your mind in an uncommon landscape.

   Wake up from the pavilion and walk to the end of the rock. After the rain, the sound of the valley is fierce. The sound of valley waters is rising to the sky on a cliff. The afternoon sun reflects off the water and shines in silver. The stream is so shiny that the entire valley is dazzling. Someone said 'Gumi 18th Scene' over this landscape. It lacked nine beauties or added nine different landscapes.

   This is what the Gumi 18 is like. Rocks next to waterfalls, ponds where meat leaps, ponds that don't know which way to cross, where the water hits, rocks where drunk people lie down, stones that break when drunk, fires in the dark, rainbows over rocks (waterfall rainbow) , Submerged and revealed pebbles, boat crossings, waterfall sounding like a thunder, waterfall foam like a squirt, rock cliffs to avoid rain, stones in water outings, springs in stone gaps, heat from railings A place to avoid (sperm rock), the sound of murmuring when dragging a cane over the sand, a drinking pub placed over you, and a oyster for books on the other side. Whether it is 'Gumi' or 'Chapter 18', it is not only praised for the beauty of nature. The scenery will be more beautiful because the lives of people who live together with nature are melted.
