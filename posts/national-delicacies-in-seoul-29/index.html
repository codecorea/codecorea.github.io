   Jeonju Yu Grandmother Bibimbap
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   In Bukchang-dong Eatery Alley, which has been changing for a long time, it has been operating for over 50 years. Grandmother's own sesame oil is filled with a spoonful of jeongjeonyu grandmother Bibimbap.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Opened in 1962 by Grandmother Yu Ho Je, Jeonju, under the name of Jeonju House, the restaurant's main menu is Bibimbap and Bean Sprout Gukbap. But for decades, it's been so good that it's been a staple.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Now the daughter-in-law, who inherited the family, instead of her grandmother, carefully wraps a spoonful of sesame oil in a sizzling boiling stone pot. The amount of herbs is so much that you can't see the rice, and it's more special thanks to the egg yolk, which makes your hands thinner instead of ups and downs. All this goes well with gochujang made from ingredients that have been handed down from home! When rubbing, the key is to mix the texture with chopsticks instead of a spoon.

   Enjoy fresh dumplings! Personality
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   There is a place in Seoul that makes the gyoza dumplings that are more unfortunate. Opened in 1967, it's a personality collection that maintains a consistent taste At this starting point is Kim Young-hee's grandmother. This house started with a round snack with wine snacks, and rumors started to grow with regulars. Although her grandmother, Kim Young-hee, died, her daughter-in-law, Moon Hyun-jin, keeps the taste as it is.

   In general, the thinner the dumpling skin is, the more delicious it is. If the dumplings are thicker, they will taste less flour if cooked less thickly, and will be fuller if miscooked. However, this unique dumpling skin is surprisingly soft and moist. It's good to dip it in the intestine, but if you eat it with a spoon and sprinkle it on top of the dumplings, the liver will be soaked in moderately deeper taste.

   Goseong Makguksu (buckwheat noodles) with 100% taste of buckwheat
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   There is a place in the outskirts of Seoul, but it is not an exaggeration to say that no one knows if it is a makguksu enthusiast. Goseong Makguksu is a place that brings out the extremes of taste by adding Dongchimi to the simplicity of buckwheat noodles.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Buckwheat is more nutritious than other grains because it contains more protein. However, buckwheat is easily broken when heated. Made from 100% pure buckwheat, it is plucked out immediately upon receipt of the order to give its guests an elastic side. Noodles as thin as noodle are made with buckwheat's own coarse texture, yet convey the scent of buckwheat.

  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Dongchimi broth is also the heart of the house! It is made every morning and stored at room temperature for one day before it ages in the fridge. Cool Dongchimi soup is refreshing and sweet instead of seasoning intensity. If you pour Dongchimi soup with flesh ice, it is the best combination in itself. Bibim Makguksu is also a non-irritating seasoning so you can fully enjoy the taste and subtle aroma of buckwheat itself.

   Knitting is a taste that can not be missed. Gangwon-do Samhab is another specialty that is spicy and spicy and wears cold in the mouth, and adds white kimchi with crisp texture. Yeolmu Kimchi and Baek Kimchi are soaked once a week and matured in the basement.
