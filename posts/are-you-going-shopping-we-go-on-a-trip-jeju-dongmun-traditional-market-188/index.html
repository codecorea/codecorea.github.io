    As a place where you can feel the area vividly wherever you go, there is no market place. It is not an exaggeration to say that the oldest and largest alumni market in Jeju is all about Jeju. It is another tourist attraction in Jeju where the island's unique and vibrant local residents can look closely and empathize with itself.

   Jeju's oldest traditional market
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Dongmun Market, located on the central road of the old city center in Jeju City, is the oldest permanent market in Jeju. With the liberation in 1945, the Jeju Dongmun Permanent Market, which is now the foundation of the Dongmun Market, was formed.
    <br/>
    Originally, the market was first created around the downstream of the Nammungak River in the Dongmun Rotary area. It is the beginning of the Dongmun Market that it has grown into a permanent market at the same time as a place to buy and sell various items every day. Dongmun Market, which was actively leading the local economy, was rebuilt in 1954 after a large fire in which 112 market buildings burned in an instant. At the time, merchants who could not enter the building opened a street stall or signboard and sold them. As the market expanded, the number of stalls decreased, but if you look around now, you can easily find the grandmothers who sell vegetables and herbs grown on the roads around them.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Dongmun Market is like a world of all things. As the largest and oldest market in Jeju Island, it has all kinds of grain, vegetables, fish, fruits, and food, as well as clothing, shoes, household goods, and farm equipment. In addition, I kept a lot of souvenirs for tourists. Dongmun Market, the path that Olle 17 course passes, has established itself as a must-see tourist attraction.

   One spring day when yellow rape flowers wave along the Namsugak Riverside. Two Hong Kong friends traveling to Jeju visited Dongmun Market. What will the alumni market look like to foreign tourists? The first place they were curious about was a fruit shop filled with sweet and sour aromas. The first item that characterizes the alumni market is orange.

   Although there may be a fruit shop in any market, Dongmun Market is probably the only place to handle oranges in all seasons. A corner of the alley of the market is painted in red and creates a pretty viewable scenery. Where is the only tangerine to eat? Some stores have brought tangerine seedlings to try to grow them. In fact, Dongmun Market without mandarin oranges is like steamed bread without bean jam.

  <div class="txt_p">

    The alumni market is large and there are many alley shops, so you may miss the party or get lost. This is especially true of the busiest and most lively fish market. Fluttering fish that seem to have just been pulled up from the sea keep walking. Among them, the most popular fish is shriveled with its shiny silvery scales. It is a fish that is expensive enough to be called ‘Geumchi’, but the line to buy Jeju silverfish is rarely reduced.

    The high price of ransom can not be overlooked. The pretty jade dome, which has a pinkish tinge like a red-hot girl, is the first fish representing Jeju. Semi-dried jade dome is grilled in sesame oil or seaweed soup is boiled before eating.
    <br/>
    “These are not as many jade domes as before. If you want a lot cheaper, you can say it is made in China. ” Tourists usually buy a lot of semi-dried jade domes, but the price is quite different for each item. Most are marked with origin, and you can ask questions.

    The most interesting thing about the market is the bargain price. “Child, cut a little more”, “Ah, I feel! Add another mackerel. ” The sound of bargaining and pulling here and there makes the market more vibrant. For those familiar with the mart's reconnaissance price, bargaining may seem like a waste of time. However, let's put a bargain on purpose at the alumni market. It is also different to experience Jeju Horse, which is completely different from the land.
