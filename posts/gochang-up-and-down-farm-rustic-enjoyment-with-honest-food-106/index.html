   'Build, Play, Eat', The Values of Up and Down Farms
  </strong>

   The word well-being that has come in and out of us. It is now a powerful motto that cannot be separated from our lives. It means that people's attention is focused on purifying the body and pursuing peace of mind beyond eating well and living well. The most responsive to these changes is the food market. Super farms such as lentil beans and aronia are popular as well as simple farm meals.

   The reason for the existence of Gochang Up and Down Farm is in line with the above flow. It opened in April with the intention of informing the importance of food. The slogan of 'build, play, eat' was also suggested as 'a place where everyone enjoys together by making honest and right food'. Sangha Farm is now attracting the attention of family travelers as it has become an experiential healing healing destination that leads the future of Korean rural areas.

   When you enter the farm through the ticket office, you will first notice the environment designed according to the natural order. Not long after its opening, some buildings are still under construction, but if you look at what has been built so far, you can see that nothing has been built. In particular, the man-made swale (dented terrain) is impressive. Called a rainwater garden, the swale prevents bad phenomena, such as flooding caused by artificial pavement of dirt, and helps the garden to be more effective by using the time the rainwater has stayed. If a rainwater garden plays a role in returning rainwater to nature, there is a place where rainwater is collected like a reservoir. The stored rainwater is purified and recycled into toilet water, which saves both water and money. As soon as you pass through the ticket office, the large garden is not only a task of beauty. It is not only a space for the viewer to feel intuition and leisure in entering the countryside, but also functions as a device to show the proper food production process. Today, only cabbage and a few kinds of herbs are ready to be harvested, but until recently it was said to have been a green field full of green barley.

   The structure of the upper and lower farms is simpler than you think. It is a workshop that produces foods honestly with ingredients given by nature, stores where you can buy homemade foods, restaurants where you can eat healthy meals, experience classes where you can make ice cream or sausages, and various animals. There are five major categories, including animal farms that can communicate with each other. Among them, the experience class is required to make a reservation in advance, which is the usual order of making a phone call two to three days in advance and making a payment on the spot.

   If you are planning an experiential trip with young children, take note. The Sangha Farm is adjacent to the old Sipo Port and is suitable as a one-day course to look around the farm and the sea. The parking lot is large, and the restaurant and restroom are equipped with baby chairs, diaper changing tables, and small toilet seat covers for children.
