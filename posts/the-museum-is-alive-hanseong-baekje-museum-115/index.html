    It's been a while but it's still cold. However, as the morning dawns, spring is waiting for the end of winter. It is the season that shows the passage of time. As we move from winter to spring, we left to meet Baekje, which once took center part of the land.

   Baek jae. The first country of the Three Kingdoms occupied the Han River. Let's start with the name. 'Baekje' comes from 'People have crossed the sea' or 'Baekjehae' or 'People have enjoyed'. This is easier to understand when following the founding myth of Baekje.

   King Onjo of Baekje is from Goguryeo. His mother is Sosono, who is married to Jumong who founded Goguryeo. Onjo's new father, Jumong, was established by marrying Sossano, the daughter of a powerful patriarch. Jumong cared for Sosono's son Onjo and his brother Liu, but he passed down the throne to his son Yuri from Buyeo. Onjo and Biryu leave their hometown with Sosono, where Biryu is located in Michu Hall, Incheon, and Onjo is located in Saori, which belongs to Mahan Land.

   Baekje, which started in the small country of Mahan, developed and developed in exchange with Japan and China based on the fertile land around the Han River. Baekje's first capital is Wiryongseong, south of the Han. It is the old name of Hansung. Hanseong means Bukseong (Pungnaptoseong), which had palaces, and Mongchontoseong, which had a palace. It is so solid that it has survived for more than a few decades.

   The northern province of Hansung, Pungnaptoseong, is an ancient castle built on flat soil. It is also quite large. The Han River flows north and west of Pungnaptoseong. Climbing to this stream, Baekje would have developed civilization by interacting with various countries. It is estimated to be 43m wide and 11m high. Some remain (except 2.2 km) except for the collapsed western wall. When you enter the Hanseong Baekje Museum, the first person you encounter is the soil layer made by removing the cross section of Pungnaptoseong.

   It was restored to the Pungnaptoseong castle, which was unearthed in 2011. At first glance it's huge. Hanseong Baekje Museum commentator said, "Though tens of centuries have passed, it means that it has been built up so firmly." "They built it and buried it together." Looking at the cross section of Pungnaptoseong castle wall in the museum, the situation is drawn by itself.

Baekje, which was founded in Seoul in 18 B.C.E. and survived until 660 C.E., started out as the first capital Hanseong (Seoul) and reigned in Woongjin (Princess) and Xabi (Buyeo). Among them, Hanseong era accounts for more than 70% of the 600-year history of Baekje. During this period, Baekje enjoyed its heyday, expanding its territory from the present Hwanghaehae Island to Jeolla-do and Jeju-do.

   After the heyday of Baekje, the third exhibition room, “Actualism of the Three Kingdoms,” will emerge. Baekje's first royal Hanseong was captured by the attack of Goguryeo Jangsu King in 475. For more than 70 years, the owner of the Han River was Goguryeo. In 551, Baekje reunited with the Silla to find the Han River basin again, but for a while. Silla, who became the new owner of the Han River two years later, has occupied the area for over 300 years. Baekje moved to Woongjin after the fall of Hanseong. Although the Han River was lost, Woongjin and Sabigi Baekje bloom unique cultures and influence Japanese ancient culture. A variety of attractions await you along with the ship model that was in charge of the trade of the Baekje era.
