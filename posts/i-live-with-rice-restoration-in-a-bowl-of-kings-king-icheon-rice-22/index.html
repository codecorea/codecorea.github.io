   Passing through Chobok and entering the center of the heat, now is the season when you need to take care of yourself. At this time, we use summer chicken with eel or chicken. Based on the style of Lee Yeol-chi-yeol introduced earlier, cool cold noodles, plural nights, and red bean shaved ice are added as summer delicacies. It's a hot season full of various styles of food, but no matter what anyone says, Koreans live with 'bapsim'. So prepared. From the old days, the rice paddy town that has caught on to the king's appetite.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Our Korean food divided into stocks and corrosion. Most Asian regions, including South Korea and neighboring China and Japan, are rice cultures that are cooked with rice and side dishes. In Western cultures where bread is eaten, wheat is replaced by rice. We need water to build our staple rice crop. This is why 'irrigation' is needed to water farmland. This required a large number of labor forces and farmers gathered around the waterways to induce community life. This characteristic of the Asian region, which shows cooperation and interdependence, emerges from the stock 'rice farming'. On the other hand, wheat, which grows on bare ground without irrigation, reveals the characteristics of the Western world, which have a strong personal and independent character.

   My parents say that they eat “white meat with meat soup” only a few times a year. It means that precious. Now that the world is better, rice consumption has decreased as food is overflowing. However, in the 1970s, when mass production of rice became possible, many wished to eat a single rice.

   The road leading to Icheon by way of National Highway No. 3 is followed by restaurants that announce “Icheon Rice Restaurant”. Many famous rice shops, such as Deokje Palace, Icheon Rice Restaurant, and King's Rice Restaurant, are quite popular on weekends and weekdays. When ordered, Icheon rice, which was suggested to the king, is put in a stone-cooker and cooked. Other grains other than rice are white rice. Sometimes black beans enter the house. Like other nutritious rice, the jujube, chestnut, pine nuts, etc. are made only with rice, but the shiny rice itself is sweet and sweet. What side dishes would not be enough to greasy and delicious rice. Precious side dishes are added to this, so it's better to loosen the belt for a while.

  <div class="txt_p">
   How about the sweet rice you eat every day? The rice itself seems to taste the dishes. Asked the owner of Icheon's rice bakery, he chose "large daylight when the sun is abundant and the rice ripens" and "a land rich in nutrients mixed with clay and sand." It would mean that the rice has the optimal natural environment to grow. Since ancient times, this is why rice was chosen as a true beauty. What is important is that Icheon Rice's reputation is not just an old story.

   The wage table Icheon rice, familiar to us, was the first rice in Korea to be attached with the wage table in the mid-1990s. The history of Icheon rice, which was on the top of the king's surat statue, is preserved as it is, and the revolutionary work was made to increase the reputation of Icheon rice.
   <br/>
   “With the“ Mika ”boom, the leisure life of our people began in earnest. What's the most important thing to play around? Isn't the Geumgang mountain after dinner? As more and more people went to and from the Seoul metropolitan area, one or two restaurants started to be built on Icheon side. At first, we put our side dishes on rice, and as people gathered and restaurants increased, we now have a huge table. ”
