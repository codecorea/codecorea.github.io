   Sejong Lake Park, located in the center of the city, is the largest in Korea and is the size of 62 soccer fields combined. The park is decorated with five themes: Festival Island, Stage Island, Water Island, Water Flower Island, and Marsh Island. At first glance, it's huge enough to take a look around, but the steps are easy. Different parks offer different landscapes and shelter.

   There are also hydroponics around the lake where you can enjoy the cool water with your children. The first place is the square fountain below the elevated gate next to the main entrance. The children jump into the rising fountains, and the adults lay down the mats under the elevated shade. The park also has special facilities for water quality management. It is a listening plant planted with purified plant to clean the water. It is a water purification facility that uses natural values to make the water of Geum River clearer and supply it to the lake.

   There is also a space with the theme of cool breeze to cool down the heat. It is a hill of wind that embodies the wind in a gentle curve. It is a place where you want to stay and rest on your own. Sit here and look at the lake and the entire park is in sight. You don't know how to spend your time in the comfort of buildings and hills that are located across the lake. But there are also disadvantages. There is no shade in this space to escape the hot summer sunshine. Take a wide hat or sunshade. If you prepare cool ice water, it is a good place to rest for a day trip.

The eldest son plain is filled with buildings, but the forest seems to have made a new plain.

   Riding wildflower trails in the 'Oulling' public bike

  <div class="txt_p">
   Handu-ri Bridge is 4 km from Lake Park. Under the bridge there were promenades, bike paths and riverside parks. It was famous for riverside wildflowers before the park was built. Even now, the wild wildflowers along with the flowers planted while decorating the park are the best. At this time, the flowers of early summer are in full bloom on both sides of the road. Non-toxic poppies scatter red flowers and yellow parasites native to North America. Ganoderma lucidum, also known as egg flower, is shyly shy. It is a landscape that goes very well with the Handuri Bridge, which has outstanding tempered rice.

   Sejong's large park is more comfortable to ride than to walk around. You can rent a bicycle at 'Oulling', a public bicycle rental place. Sejong City operates 29 hanging rental stations and 386 cradles, so it is free to rent and return anywhere in the city. You can check the location and situation of the rental station and the cradle in real time through the Oulling homepage.

   Public bicycles can be used by anyone over the age of 19 with their mobile phone number. Rentals are made using unmanned information terminals. The one-day pass costs 1,000 won. However, every 90 minutes after rental, you must return and re-rent at the terminal. If it is over 90 minutes without re-renting, an additional fee of 1,000 won will be charged every 30 minutes.
