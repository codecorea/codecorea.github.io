    It's summer. Even if you are still sweating. Both slim and serious people need to take care of themselves in the heat. Samgyetang, which helps smooth gastrointestinal function and eel, has been found for recovery. All are low fat and high protein. If you listen to it, your arms and legs are strong.

    Samgyetang is one of the first hands to be a summer food. Samgyetang is a chicken that has fallen in the water that everyone would have tasted if they had been born and raised on this land. When the hot days swelling in the heat or when the body is desolate, the chicken baeksook was carefully pampered. When you get sick in the West, you eat chicken soup, so chicken seems to be indispensable.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Samgyetang (蔘 鷄湯), as the name adds chicken and ginseng, jujube, garlic, etc. are added. Trim the chicken clean and add glutinous rice, garlic and jujube to your stomach to pour water and boil. Sambok-myeon is more visited thanks to the summer's representative lifestyle. Chicken, ginseng, and glutinous rice are added to the abalone or other tonic ingredients.

   Samgyetang is a national treasure that requires no explanation. Samgyetang is not my mother's orphan, but I searched for Samgyetang specialty store that is not a problem in the hot weather. When you're tired and tired of being hit by a living, and you're feeling hot, let's go to `` chicken broth for the soul. ''

   First of all, you don't need to talk. The legendary samgyetang restaurant is famous as the president's regular house. It is difficult to avoid waiting in line whether or not there are many people. It is hard to expect friendly service because there are many people looking for it. Nevertheless, foreign tourists join in, and the number of guests is overflowing. Not only ginseng and glutinous rice, but also other herbs are added, and the soup is heavy and fragrant. Good for those who like rich flavors.

   Next is Goryeo Samgyetang, located in Seosomun-dong. You can see Samgyetang specialty shops with the same name. Kori Samgyetang, which boasts more than half a century of tradition, is located in Seosomun and Sejong-ro. Thanks to the clear and plain broth, women prefer it. Changan Samgyetang is located in the same city hall. Changan Samgyetang, which is characterized by its uniqueness, appeals to the nearby workers with its ordinary weapons. &lt;Koryo Samgyetang&gt; is easy to find if you come out of Subway City Hall Station Exit 7 and &lt;Jangan Samgyetang&gt; Exit 10. In addition, Gangwonjeong and Singil-dong's Lake Samgyetang, located in the alley of Yongsan Police Station, are specialty shops that cannot be missed.

  <div class="txt_p">
   If the samgyetang introduced above is 'classic', there is a 'chicken drowned' that you can enjoy more casually. One chicken kalguksu. On the opposite side of Gwangjang Market and behind Dongdaemun Market, there are grilled fish houses and a chicken house. It is easy to understand when you think about Samgyetang that appears in the yangpon. It is also good to be able to take care of the body at a lower price, but the taste of boiling fresh kimchi into the broth is also amazing.

   One more thing is that it can be manufactured according to taste and taste. The downside is that it's too hot.

   Depending on your taste, add seasoning, garlic and sour kimchi to boil. Don't forget the kalguksu, which is boiled in the remaining broth after all the chickens have been eaten. The charm of one chicken kalguksu is that two chickens can be boiled for a bowl of samgyetang. Several specialty shops are gathered, starting with &lt;Jinokhwa Mae-mae-dong Chicken&gt;. If you don't like chickens that are drowning in water, you can also boil your body with Andong Braised Chicken, Chicken Stir-Fried Tang, ‘치네 님’, or chicken.

   Next is freshwater eel. The taste is also delicious but is popular as a natural nourishing tonic. If you chew one eel in your mouth, you can see for yourself how high he is. The succulent but juicy gravy! But the price is not formidable. Expensive too expensive It usually costs over 70,000 won per kg. Some may sell maridans. It also costs 3 to 40,000 won, which is definitely not a light food. Park salaries are either big hearted or earned, or mostly one of them. You don't have to pass it until it's natural. Only if you're not a good gourmet can you see the subtle differences. You should be able to taste it enough. Here are some of the most popular eel shops for luck days.
