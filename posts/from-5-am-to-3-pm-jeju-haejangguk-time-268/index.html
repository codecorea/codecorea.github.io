   Its addictive taste! Breeze Haejangguk
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Haejangguk is the first place in Jeju. Regardless of whether you have eaten it or not, the ‘mipoong’ equation is commonly used among people in Haejangguk. A bowl of spicy and generous Haejangguk not only hangs up overnight, but also makes the journey early in the morning.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Haejanggukjip The reason why Mipung Haejangguk stands out even in many Jeju islands is the 'unchanging taste' that has been observed for many years. Mipung Haejangguk, which boasts a tradition of over 40 years, is famous for its unique addictive taste. The reason why it is essential to become a regular once a regular, is still sincerity and honesty with the same taste even after several decades.

   The first secret of this house, which is based on the Seonji Haejangguk, is the broth that has been brewed without fear. Mipung Haejangguk, CEO of New Jeju Kim Jae-hyung, tries hard to draw broth every day. It's a hard work that requires you to sweat and work for hours, but thanks to that, the soup is much richer and deeper. The second trick is homemade red chili oil sauce. The spicy and savory taste of the breeze comes from this sauce. 'No comment' is not only how to draw broth, but also how to make seasoning. Here, Zenji, Guernsey, bean sprouts, and Siraegi are filled with pots.

   The peculiar thing is that if you ask to remove or add more ingredients according to your preference when ordering, you will be served accordingly. This is thanks to the fact that the ingredients are prepared separately and when the order comes in, the soup is poured into the pot and boiled once more. For this reason, the original taste and texture of each ingredient comes out. ‘Kakduk-guk’ is a delicacy that makes Haejangguk even more delicious. If you take a sip before meals, the cool and sour taste will boost your taste buds.

Inside the pot is full of boiled soup, it is full of thick paper and yangji, bean sprouts and siraegi, and vermicelli. Especially, soybean sprouts are added in plenty so that it can be called as bean sprouts. Depending on your preference, Sunji can order more or less.

That is why children eat well soon. It is also a taste that people who are new to Haejangguk can eat without hesitation. If you add chopped garlic properly, the flavor will be deeper.

    Bony Haejangguk, with its thick flesh, just looks over at the saliva. It is a dish that tastes great with the broth that has been crushed for a long time. 3 ~ 4 bones are so big that they appear small enough to appear small, and even if you eat only the meat attached to it, your stomach will swell. Where is that? Even a pot of pork bones, one that looks strong, is added as a bonus. Grab it like an ice cream, eat it cleanly, and eat the bone marrow in your ear.

    Another advantage is that it does not have any peculiar smell of pigs because it uses only Jeju pigs. Here, the boiled boiled ooze adds a rich flavor. The only thing that entered Haejangguk is pork bones and beef. But that is enough. It is a feeling that the moderately thick and savory broth will keep the empty stomach. One bowl of Bone Haejangguk soup enjoys the best of both eyes and mouth. Another attractive point! It tastes good, but it's nice to the price. Bony Haejangguk (Korean haejangguk) is 6,000 won.
