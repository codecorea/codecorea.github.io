   Ginkgo leaves seem to be a week slower than any other year because of heat and drought, the locals say. This year, you will be able to enjoy the yellow waves of Cheongna Bank Village until a little later.

   How did Ginkgo live here? The legend of the village is told. Since ancient times, Janghyeon Village (Cheongna Bank Village) has been called Oseosan because there are many crows. A yellow pit lived by a small pond under the mountain. The worm prayed for ease every day for a thousand years. On the day of the millennium, the goblin finally became Hwang Ryong and ascended with Yeouiju. Crows around Oseo-san watched this scene. Later, the crows looked for food, found a yellow bank, and thought that it was Yeoui-ju, which Hwang was biting. That is why Ginkgo trees are now inhabited in Janghyeon village.

   Apart from the legend, there are also entities that reveal the origin of Cheongna Bank Village. It is a 500-year-old Sugo tree in front of the nerve house (Chungcheongnam-do Cultural Heritage No. 291). The ginkgo trees of Cheongna Bank Village are almost dark trees. After a round of town, the smell from the tip of the shoe proves this. The 500-year-old ginkgo biloba has played a role in bringing the fruit of many dark trees in the Cheongna ginkgo village.

   Ginkgo trees that are aesthetically cultivated in the city have many trees that do not bear fruit, but in rural areas, they grow many trees that bear fruit because their purpose is for living. At one time, the villagers called ginkgo trees as 'college trees'. When the bank quotes were good, a few trees helped me get my college tuition.

   Ginkgo trees stand along the fields, along the streams and along the earthen houses. There is no artificial feeling. It's as natural as it is. That is because the Cheongna Bank Village is not a place for planting and decorating Ginkgo trees to show people. As the villagers planted and grown a lot of ginkgo trees, they became known for the autumn leaves and tourists began to visit.

   The points of the bank villages are Sinseop House and Jeongchon Organic Farm. Among them, Sinseop house is the best rice in the bank village. The house is a hanok, the late Joseon Dynasty. Around the old house are ginkgo trees over 100 years old. Dignity can be felt in the landscape of old-fashioned houses and trees. At first glance, it's too bad to see it. It is fun to look thirsty outside. When thirsty for the intact landscape is at its peak, spraying the yard takes its foot. It's as if you're walking into a single elegant painting. The scenery of thirsty staring outside the fence and the view from the courtyard are attractive.

   The annual Cheongna Bank Village Festival is held from late October to early November. During the festival, there are various experience programs centered on the former Janghyeon Elementary School. This year's festival took place on October 29 and 30. The festival is over, but don't be afraid. The peak of autumn leaves has not passed since this year's bank leaves were late. Rather, the village's advice is that from the first weekend in November to the second week of the week, you can savor the yellow waves of the Cheongna bank village. It would be great to visit Cheongna Bank Village during the best time to see autumn leaves, but it may be a little early or a little late. The lush peaks of the beautiful ginkgo trees are beautiful, but the mysterious moment of the transition from fresh green to yellow is also fascinating.
