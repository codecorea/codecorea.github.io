   What about the process of telling stories to these characters? The story section captures the eyes as if the artists were working and just moved away from the studio. Hundreds and thousands of storyboards, as well as video, convey the progress intact. In particular, the 'pitching' video, which conveys the story vividly like a grandmother who told a story in her childhood, is a must-see point!

   The last section of the world is full of fun. There are numerous studies and worries to express the worldview of each piece in a realistic way. In particular, the best way to experience this exhibition is Bird's Eye View!
