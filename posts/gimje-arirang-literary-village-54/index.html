   'Ginger blind gang other emmit'. 'Jinge' means 'Gimje', 'Meng Gang' means Mangyeong, and 'Oemit' means lazy people. It is the old saying of Gimje Mangyeong Plain, Korea's representative granary. The wicked horde of Japanese colonial beasts have been spreading the land since the early 1900s. To send military beauty to the battlefield to fill their ambitions. The novelist Jo Jung-rae wrote in Arirang the history of suffering and resistance that the minchos had to face in this process.

   Meet the years of raging in the novel Arirang
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Why is the title of the novel Arirang? Arirang is a song that our people shared with us when we were happy or sad. The background of the novel is from the pre-Korean merger to liberation, when Arirang's ringing is the loudest. Let's take a look at the audience watching Na Un Kyu's movie Arirang in Arirang. "Kim Young-jin is being dragged by the Japanese police and the melody of" Arirang "that the band plays begins. Arirang Arirang Aririo .... When the chorus was just over, "to the independence of Korea!" It was a man's cry. "To the independence of Korea!" The novelist Cho Jung-rae said that he easily wrote the title Arirang. This may be because there is no title as appropriate as Arirang.

   Arirang Literature Village reproduces the stage of the novel Arirang in reality, revealing the painful days without filtration. Since the story of Arirang begins in Juksan-myeon, Gimje-si, it has been built around the old inner village and Oori village, so travelers can experience living literature. Arirang Literary Village is largely composed of public relations hall, Harbin station, Naechon and Oeri village, and modern seizure agency. The PR Hall is itself a friendly guide to Arirang.

   Although Arirang is a best-selling book, many of them have been burdened with reading because it is a 12-volume novel. The first floor of the PR building filled the walls with text about Arirang. The plot of the flow of the novel, the portrayal of the characters and the relationship of the main characters, and the excerpts of the core anecdotes in the novel are organized in a structure. Just look around slowly and read easily to find out what Arirang is.

   Combining the historical background of Harbin and Arirang, there is an incident that comes to mind quickly. According to Harbin Ahn (1909). When you go out through the waiting room in the area, the best scenes of modern history are realistically expressed in statues. When Ahn Jung-geun pulls the trigger, a bullet carrying the nation's core penetrates the heart of the empire. Ito Hirobumi was shortly after getting off the train, so steam locomotives also appeared in those days.

At least you and your house are likely to play a role, but the reeds are too poor. In Arirang, a reed hut appears. "People who gathered a bunch of reeds began to make huts. The huts were to dig the ground into man's height and cover the roof with reeds on it."

   The municipal office is the leading organization in the exploitation of land. Baek Jong-du, a pro-Japanese leader appointed to Juksan-myeon in Arirang, opposes the peasants by forming a landlord commissioner (a vanguard that pursues the land inspection project of the governor general). It is a land survey project, but it is a trick to take away the land of Joseon by attaching a secret bad clause. In the Juksan-myeon Office, there are telescopes, compasses, cameras, abacus, and lighters. It is obvious that it was used as a tool for evil.
