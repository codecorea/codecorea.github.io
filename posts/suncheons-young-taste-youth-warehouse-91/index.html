   10 minutes walk from Suncheon Station. There is a youth warehouse that leads to a hot place near the Chogok-dong Nonghyup. Traces of time are felt at once on the dark outer wall. This is a complex cultural space that remodeled the grain warehouse built in the Japanese colonial period as a founding place for young people.

   First of all, I stopped in front of today's Tokatatsu. Although ramen is the main menu, only 15 bowls a day were sold at Sake-dong. The boss cut the thick raw salmon thick at the same time as the order. Even if the fish is large enough to wrap around the cutlery, it will be eaten in more than 10 pieces. The boss, 31, said he had never touched salmon before. When asked how he thought of the challenge, the answer came back, "I like salmon." The taste is as it looks. The fresh raw salmon fillets with sweet crispy onions and crispy rice. Even if you eat a lot of spicy raw wasabi will not eat the thick salmon to eat until the end.

   In 'city fish cake', there are many dishes that can be eaten one by one, such as shrimp fish cake, cheese fish cake, red pepper fish cake, and octopus skewer balls. Cheese sticks, which are especially popular among women, are plunged into the barrel to create a salty and savory flavor. Pepper paste contains minced meat with whole peppers. It's just one spicy flavor that adds a totally different taste. All menus are made in-store and fried so you can trust them. The fish cake gimbap wrapped in the surface of kim rice with fish cake was not sold because it was sold out early.
