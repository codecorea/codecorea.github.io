    The road to Dinosaur Egg Fossil in Hwaseong-si, Gyeonggi-do, was a place where the seawater shook. Wetland plants, such as reeds and turkeys, began to grow on the reclaimed land created by the creation of the Sihwa Seawall. As the ground hardened, it became possible to walk to the islands called upper salt, heavy salt, and lower salt, and found about 30 eggs and over 200 dinosaur eggs. It was in 1999. These dinosaur egg fossils are considered to be the world's three largest dinosaur egg fossils and were designated as a natural monument No. 414 in 2000.

   A trail leading through a wide reed field leads to a wooden deck. Its length is 1.53km, so if you walk slowly between the reed fields, it is a wonderful way to forget even the thoughts of dinosaur eggs. It seems to be walking in an unrealistic landscape where there is only sunlight and wind. There is a small observation deck and log bench in the middle, so you can take a break. This is where the vast reed field washes your eyes and the wind blows your heart.

   The wooden deck leads to the four rocky mountains that were once islands. The rocky mountain composed of red conglomerate and sandstone reveals the traces of the sea water. Among them, dinosaur fossils found in heavy salt have been released to the public. In addition to heavy salt, dinosaur egg fossils have been found on chicken islands and ant islands in the northeast, and many dinosaur egg fossils are expected to be hidden on the bottom of tidal flats. This is because this area was a colony of dinosaurs.

   The Cretaceous Period of the Mesozoic Era 100 million years ago, when many dinosaurs stayed here and laid eggs, is a long time ago. However, I think the dinosaur traces may still be hidden under the vast reed field, so it seems that the dinosaur will walk out with a ‘kung-kung’ footsteps somewhere.
   <br/>
   Dinosaur egg fossil learning version of heavy salt is a dinosaur egg fossil that is gathered in the middle of the earth. It is not possible to determine what dinosaur the mother was, but the small size suggests that it was a herbivorous dinosaur.

    If you walk the long reed trail again and go to the visitor center, you can find a description of dinosaur egg fossils and various materials about dinosaurs. The fossils of the Korea Ceratops Hwaseong Nsys found in the nearby Jeokok Port breakwater are also displayed. It is a new genus and species of horned dinosaur that was first discovered in Korea, meaning `` Korean ceratopsian dinosaur found in Mars. '' It is also unusual to see the process of processing dinosaur eggs fossils. On the second floor, the movie hall screens images of the dinosaur age environment every 20 minutes.

   Let's get out of the Dinosaur Egg Fossil of Jeongjeong-ri and go to the Sihwa Lake Observatory, operated by the Korea Water Resources Corporation. Sihwa Embankment, Daebu Island, and Sihwa Lake reclamation area are all at a glance. It is still unpaved, so you have to run for a while on a bumpy, unpaved road, but it is a place where word of mouth is also known as a photo club's outlook because of the beautiful sunset over the reclamation area.

   When you come back and head for Masan-ri, the full-scale drive course begins. Masan-ri, formerly a seaside port town, is a famous producer of Songsan grapes. The vineyards in the low hills are spectacular, especially when you pass Masan-ri on a summer day when the grapes are ripening, the sweet grape scent vibrates. You can also buy freshly picked grapes from a roadside retailer.

   The reclamation road starts at the end of Masan-ri. After passing a short unpaved section with the island on the left side, famous for the light aircraft boarding experience, you will see an asphalt pavement that stretches out. It is a way to run slowly while being escorted by shiny reeds under the sunshine. This reed field is large enough to resemble the great plains of foreign countries, and has become a regular filming location for TV dramas and movies.
   <br/>
   When the Sihwa Seawall floodgate opens, water enters here, creating an environment like a tidal flat, transforming it into a habitat for various animals. Shiwha Lake once smelled rotten, causing many people's worries and sighs. However, nature proved to have the ability to purify and regenerate itself, and it brought new life. Elk and bunting run, egrets and mallards fly for food.

   This road should slow down as fast as possible and pass slowly. Birds floating on water in search of food may be amazed. Birdwatchers, who watch cars from the side of the road with a telescope, can be bored.
   <br/>
   “You have to be careful when crossing this road. The birds are surprised by the noise of the vehicle. We're hiding here in the car and watching the birds. Sometimes, because of the people driving in a hurry, when the birds are surprised and go away, they go to another place again. The grandmother in the white car down there watches the birds all the way back and forth all day, and I really like birds. ”
   <br/>
   This is a story of a low-pitched voice by a searcher on the road to take a picture.
   <br/>
   The bird's mind floats in peace, making the viewer's mind peaceful. A willow tree that grows with roots in its roots makes a reclaimed land like a picture.
   <br/>
   The mountain overlooking the willow is an island called Hyeongdo. At one time, fishing boats went in and out, but now they have been incorporated into reclamation lands and have become islands rather than islands.

Even now, clams, clams, jukkumi, and octopus are abundant, and you can also taste the seafood that has been prepared on the spot in the restaurant inside.
