    Difficulty became good news. The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul, stands on a constrained land, but it stands out. While keeping the historicity of the space, I lowered my body and opened the way. The museum became a road, a square, and an island of art.

   From Gyeongbokgung Intersection, head towards Samcheong-dong. The fence on the east side of Gyeongbokgung Palace is a side by side path. Opposite the line are galleries of art such as Gallery Hyundai, Kumho Museum, Hakgojae, and Kukje Gallery. Gallery Hyundai is a neighborhood that has occupied an axis of Korean art for a long time since it was relocated in 1975. That is why it is not just the entrance to Samcheong-dong, but also called Sagan-dong Gallery.

    Here, a bold art space has entered. This is the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul, which opened in November 2013. After the Gwacheon Hall and Deoksugung Hall, it is the third National Museum of Contemporary Art. The Seoul Pavilion was controversial even before the decision was made on the current site. After the decision was made, it was considered an easy challenge. This is because of the historicity of the location. First of all, Gyeongbokgung Palace was located with one road in between. The old father, who was in the Jeongdok Library, was also restored, and the former ROK Armed Forces Command, which was built in the early 20th century, was also Registered Cultural Property No. 375. The environment of Samcheong-dong, Sogyeok-dong, and Sagan-dong, which are the entrances to Bukchon, and the existing village circulation were also considered. It was initially impossible to become a landmark in Seoul by vertically rising due to various regulations.

   Architect Hyun-Jun Min, who was in charge of the construction of the Seoul Pavilion, solved it as an archipelago that seems to have several islands, large and small. Seven buildings are grouped like an island, forming a whole called Seoul Hall. A public square was created between the building and the building to increase publicity. We aimed for an open art museum without walls.

   Like a wave flowing through the island, it passes through a square on a road and enters into an art museum or walks through the outer space just like walking through a park. Although it is an art museum, it is a park, a square, and a road. In the meantime, the buildings that differed in time reveal the historicity of Seoul as they travel to large and small islands of different ages. In addition, because of its low buildings, it has a unique landscape around Inwangsan. It is a magical run and wandering.

   It is because of these characteristics that the Seoul Pavilion was well received. We have diversified the points of contact between ordinary visitors and potential visitors, Seoul citizens. Most of all, it breaks the preconception that modern art is difficult because the museum does not set itself up.

   The first impression was an old Kimusa temple built in the early 20th century. It is a space that serves as both the exhibition hall and the office building of the Seoul Hall. In 1928, it opened as an outpatient clinic of the affiliated clinic of Gyeongseong Medical College and expanded in 1932 ~ 3. It is the first basement level and the third basement level. After independence, it was used as the second affiliated hospital of the Seoul Medical University and the Army Integrated Hospital. It is also an important structure for architects because it is decorated with bricks in a reinforced concrete frame. The old Kimusa building was transformed as part of the Seoul Pavilion. The white paint was peeled off to restore red bricks at the time of completion. This is a new building for those with old memories, but it is still in its original form.

   After entering the entrance, head straight for the ticket office. For the first visit, we recommend that you go through the entrance to the Gimusa Temple and enter the art gallery yard. It's between the old Kimusa building and the Gangui-dong building. Prior to the yard, attention is focused on the open yard in front of Gangui-dong. Three birch trees stretched out toward Gyeongbokgung Palace. Wisteria tree is an evergreen tree planted in the royal courtyard. Young shadows on the glass of Gangui-dong attract attention. Not surprisingly, these trees, which were 170 years old, have been there even before the entrance of the Seoul Pavilion and the Knights. From the late Joseon Dynasty, we watched the upheaval of modern history with two eyes. Before the Seoul Pavilion, he is a witness and the history of the land. These are the trees that have been treated the most. It is possible to know the reason for standing and receiving special treatment like Jang Seung.

   Standing in the back of the rain tree, Gangui-dong is decorated with terracotta tiles. The light brown tile seems to be solid, but it has four colors. The calm and unflinching color scheme harmonizes with the characteristics of other buildings that make up the museum. You can go straight to the art gallery yard, but pass down the river, and head towards Jongchinbu. The left side of the aisle is an underground exhibition yard with a high wall but not visible. As an outdoor space on the basement floor, it helps natural light on the ground to seep into the underground exhibition hall. However, another meaning of the road is the fact that it is a village's transit route.

   Jongchinbu, Seoul's tangible cultural property No. 9, was the institution that kept the genealogy and portraits of the king and took care of the royal family's work. The area around Jongchinbu was a place where Saganwon and Gyujanggak were located, and its significance was special. The Seoul Pavilion entered and restored what was moved to the Jeongdok Library while the knight was in charge. Even if it was built around the father's father, the Seoul Pavilion forms the center of the art museum, not an exaggeration. When I turn to meet the eyes of my father's widow, I realize that. It is a lawn that corresponds to the roof of the 5th exhibition hall of the museum, and it moves as if taken in the landscape.

   Between the red bricks of the old Kimusa temple and the terracotta exterior of Gangui-dong, the walls of Gyeongbokgung Palace and the mountains of Inwangsan were like ink. Past and present, city and nature blend in one frame. It is clear that the lower my body, the more I can bear more. At your feet, you can see people going across the yard of the museum. It also reveals how the old brick wall and the newly built art gallery meet. You don't have to stand up and see. On the lawn, Seungyoung Kim's work, &lt;Warm Chair&gt;, responds to visitors. It is a red boiler-type chair, 36.5 degrees, equal to a person's body temperature. If you sit on top of it and warm up, the warmth reaches your heart.

   The interior of the museum's interior exhibition hall is no different from the exterior. Rather than being stiff, we respect the choices of visitors. Architect Hyun-Jun Min compares with Rotonda at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, designed by Frank Gary. If the Guggenheim Museum defines the circulation in advance, the Seoul Museum is free to open the circulation of visitors. The main advantage is that as the main buildings are floating like an archipelago, the eight exhibition halls inside can be explored as if exploring space. It does not lead directly to the exhibition hall from the lobby. In the east, the works of Seoul Box show up slightly. Beyond that, the horizontal window shows a slight trace of his father-in-law. The other side is the red brick of the Kimusa building. If you pass underneath and go to the left, it is the entrance to the art museum coming from Gimusa. In the aisle was a museum shop. This also breaks the framework of the Jongrye, which is located at the end of the museum's Dongseon.

   The exhibition begins by entering the entrance on the first floor. Writer Shin Hyun-joong's Republican Guard stands slightly in front. It is an interesting piece that resembles a salamander. The first exhibition hall is on the right and the stairs to the rear are the eighth exhibition hall on the second floor. The first exhibition room controls the amount of natural light because it is a screen ceiling. Natural light that illuminates the entire space relieves viewers of fatigue. When you go down the escalator, you can see the 7th exhibition hall from the 2nd exhibition hall centered on the Seoul box. Meanwhile, there are media labs and movie theaters. The north is an exhibition yard under the left wall of the road to Jongchinbu and an exhibition space leading to the ground floor.

   If you go down to the first basement level, you will first encounter the Seoul box. It is the most interesting exhibition hall. It is a space of light without diffused light coming in and without shadow. It is an exhibition space that reaches 17m in height and is currently underway by Seo Do-ho's &lt;Hanjin Shipping Box Project&gt;. &lt;House in House, House in House, House in House&gt; made of blue polyester fabric creates a hanok in a house floating in the air inside a western-style house. In the central hall going from the Seoul box to the multi-project hall, Choi U-ram's on-site production installation project &lt;Opertus Lunula Umbra (Hidden Shadow of the Moon)&gt; was caught in the air. Works resembling a crescent moon or a caterpillar move as if spreading their wings as if breathing at regular intervals. On the ceiling where the work was installed, colored panels of Saekdong were attached. It is the only decoration in the interior where there is only a partition and a movement line without much decoration. In the surroundings, artworks full of individuality await in each exhibition room. You don't have to go back in order. It's best to watch the fish freely as you walk, as if swimming in the sea. So is the designer's intention. Edwin van der Heider's installation work &lt;Evolutionary Spark Network&gt;, which fills a 15m-wide and 12m-long space, and Philip Bisley's &lt;Vegetation Botanical Garden&gt; collaborated by architects, engineers, and designers are more interesting when they come across like a coincidence. .

   After the exhibition, it is time to go outside and hang around the museum. We even enjoy the beauty of the space that has been missed. The harmony created by meeting and breaking up with the surrounding space is another pleasure to greet the Seoul Hall. Then, you can move back to Gyeongbok Palace, Samcheong-dong, Sogyeok-dong, or Bukchon Hanok Village. The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul has the island as its concept, but it is one of the countless islands. It meets the surrounding spaces and forms and completes a perfect entity. It is for this reason that it has a history of Seoul that is disgusting in its arms.
