   Spring starts from the south. The spring energy that has risen to Jeju Island through Jeju Island spreads in all directions. The flowers that concealed me from the cold wind reveal a beautiful appearance in the warm spring sunlight. This is a great comfort for travelers who have had a long and cold tail. I missed the scenery of the blooming flowers and ran to Gwangyang, Jeollanam-do. It is a journey that the red camellia forest welcomes.

   If you want to know where spring is coming, let's climb the camellia forest of Gwangyang Okryongsa. The camellia, which bursts out of red buds, forms a forest, regardless of the cold grumpy. The imposing of the camellia flowers, which begin to bloom from late winter, seemingly trying to push away all the remaining cold.

   The way to the temple. 'Where can I go to see flowers?' And there is no need to be impatient. After passing the parking lot, the camellia forest begins. It is a path in which the green of the shiny leaves and the red color of the camellia flower contrast. If you walk with your eyes fixed to the sky while looking at a camellia in full bloom, a well comes out far away. It is said that if you make a wish by drinking this well water, it will come true.

   From this point on, it was the place where the Seonguksa Temple was founded in Silla. Doseon, known as the master of Feng Shui Geography, is said to have planted camellia trees in order to compensate for the lack of energy in the land. The forest with more than 7,000 camellia trees planted around the temple is currently protected as Natural Monument No. 489.

   When you pass a tree standing behind a well, a small pond emerges. 'Doseon Guksa Temple Chamseon-gil' spreads beside the pond. It is easy to walk by placing a wooden deck. When you enter the road, the camellia is so dense that you cannot see the sky. The branches lined up on both sides are scared of even snow. If someone finds a heart made of camellia petals that have fallen on the floor, it's good to see them. It is the most suitable shape made of passionate red. After a short walk on the meditation path, return and enter the Jade Dragon Temple.

   If you want to hear more about the camellia forest and the Jade Dragon Temple, you can ask the cultural commentator working at the tourist information center.

It is also special fun to hear the serene pride of the cultural commentator that you can see the beautiful flower scenery when you see the mountain across the parking lot.

   If you went to Gwangyang to see spring flowers, you can't miss Maehwa Village. In March, the Seomjin River, centered around Maehwa Village, is colored with white petals. On the way to Maehwa Village along the Seomjin River Maehwa-ro, the snow rushes over the blooming flowers. The Gwangyang Plum Festival is held every year at this time, so it is a busy street with event booths and crowds along the road. Unfortunately, in 2017, the festival was canceled to prevent the spread of AI, but in 2018, from March 15th to 25th, the plum festival is normally held so you can enjoy the festival.

The plum-covered plump white as if it were snowed down is a true scenery. One of the highlights of Maehwa Village is the path that leads to the trees with both sides. The scenery of the Seomjin River that comes in front of you from anywhere in the village makes itself elastic.
