   There are such people. An alley that only I know, a gourmet that only goes to me. The small desire to keep everyone's own space without wanting to inform anyone seems to be selfish and timid, but the inner heart of saving that space is more affectionate and passionate than anyone else. This is the heart of people who love the alleys of Yeonnam-dong.

   After walking off the bustling street at the intersection of Exit 3 of Hongik University Subway Station and walking for about 10 minutes on the left side of the street, you will see a small alley going down the side of the Kimbab House. This is a small alley leading to Yeonhui-dong, the old address of Yeonnam-dong, located at 227. Gallery, bookstore, coffee shop, and restaurant representing Yeonnam-dong are gathered in the alleyway overlooking the neighborhood at a glance.

More than 30㎡, this is a non-profit space that begins as an artistic shelter for residents of Yeonnam-dong, where free and innovative exhibitions of young artists such as installation, sculpture, furniture, and paintings can be freely continued.

    Most restaurants in Yeonnam-dong are open until noon. It is a small store run by one or two people, so there are many things to prepare. “Bemucho Cantina”, with five tables, is decorated with ornaments from Mexico, the owner's hometown, and is like a pub in Mexico.

   The Bemucho Cantina, shortened to the “Besame Mucho Tavern,” is a place where Mexican men and women from Yeonnam-dong meet and cook Mexican home-cooked meals. The owner, who has a strong sense of cooking experience in Mexico, offers fresh and hearty Mexican cuisine by picking local ingredients. It is basic to use fresh lettuce and tomatoes. By making use of the taste of the hometown, they produce exotic and delicious Mexican food.

  <div class="txt_p">

    During lunchtime, a long line of curry pours along the smell of the sweet curry. The representative menu of Himeji is curry rice. The old bicycle shop reminds me of a small home in a Japanese residential area. It is a cozy and comfortable atmosphere where the curry rice is good for indoors.

   Curry rice, cooked in a Japanese style with only vegetables such as potatoes, carrots, and broccoli, is familiar to us. The popular curry udon, which is eaten with curry, is also popular.
