   Singer Kim Hyun-cheol, who sang &lt;The Train to Chuncheon&gt;, said that he made this song by remembering the gloomy memories he had in Gangchon without going to Chuncheon Station because he couldn't afford his heart when he was unlucky. At that time, the place called Chuncheon might have felt quite a bit far away, but now the travel time between Cheongnyangni and Chuncheon is much shorter thanks to the semi-high-speed train ITX, so I don't think there will be any unfortunate things that couldn't go to Chuncheon.

    ITX operates between Yongsan, Cheongnyangni, Pyeongnae-hopyeong, Gapyeong, Namchuncheon, and Chuncheon stations. Depending on the time of day, it stops at other stations such as Maseok, Cheongpyeong, and Gangchon. If you are looking for a place to go for an autumn trip, let's get down to Gapyeong Station first. If you take the city tour bus in front of Gapyeong Station, you can visit various attractions from Nami Island to Morning Calm Arboretum, Petite France, and Jara Island.

    How about feeling an exotic autumn in Korea? As the name suggests, it is reminiscent of “Little France” and is famous for filming locations for dramas such as Beethoven Virus and Secret Garden. Although not very large, it has a variety of attractions, including the Saint Exupery Memorial, the French Traditional House Exhibition, the Music Box House and the European Doll House. In addition, various performances such as mime, puppet show, marionette, and music box play are added to add special charm.

    If you need phytoncide, go to Gugok Falls. It is a gentle course of about 20 minutes from the ticket office to the waterfall, so everyone can walk easily. If you want to feel the energy of autumn, let's take a little more power and climb up to Munbae Village, a remote mountainous village. You will climb for about 40 minutes along the ridge guide board on the right side of the entrance to the Gokgok Falls. Munbae Village, which seems to sit on the top of a mountain, is famous for its restaurants selling wild vegetable bibimbap or local chicken. A small ecological park is full of silver grass, so it is good to see the autumn leaves and silver grass in autumn.

   Rail Park Kim Yu-jeong Station is impressive with the theme of literary books from Gangwon-do, in line with local characteristics. In addition, there are Kim Yu-Jung Literature Village and Sillay Yagi-gil near Kim Yu-Jung Station, making it suitable for autumn trips. ITX does not stop at Kim Yu-jeong Station with this charm. Therefore, if you want to visit Kim Yu-jeong Station during your ITX trip, getting off at Namchuncheon Station is the easiest way.

   The final stop of the ITX descending line is Chuncheon Station. Not long ago, when I got off at Chuncheon Station, the surrounding scenery was not very good. This is because there was a long line of unsightly fences on the camp page, a US military unit, in front of Chuncheon Station. However, if you are looking for Chuncheon Station, you will be amazed by the changed surrounding scenery.

   This is because the fence of the camp page was destroyed in June and it was completely opened under the name of 'Chuncheon Peace Ecological Park'. Rapeseed field was established in June, and now the place is in full swing, the autumn messenger. There are many people who can walk through the wide cosmos field and take pictures. On one side, there is a small zoo with sheep, horses, rabbits, etc., which children love. If you are having trouble traveling in the autumn, take the ITX on the second floor train to Chuncheon Station. The romantic and tranquil scenery of the train journey will give you a 100-point autumn trip.
