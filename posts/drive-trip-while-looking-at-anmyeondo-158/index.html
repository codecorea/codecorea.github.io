   The most common way to get to Taemyeon's Anmyeondo is to cross the Seosan AB district shelter from Hongseong IC of the West Coast Expressway. If you follow the coastal road south of Gongnipo-gu before Seosan AB Earthquake began, the Namdang Port and Cheonbuk Guldan are well known for their fresh and abundant seafood, as well as Hongseong's Sokdong Observatory, Hongseong Embankment Observatory, and Chungcheongsu Swimming Coastal Observatory.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Most of the tourists who enter the Anmyeondo with the excitement of the summer trip come out of the Honghae IC of the West Coast Expressway and cross the Seosan AB district. But just before crossing the seawall, let's run from Hari Intersection towards the coastal road. It doesn't lead to a single road, but most can run along the sea from Hongseong to Boryeong. It is a road running to the left with only Cheonsu and looking at Anmyeondo, which is like a long and long belt.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   If you get off at the Hari Intersection just before crossing the Seosan AB District Embankment, Imhae Tourist Road begins. Imhae Tourist Road is a 16km road from Bugi-ri, Galsan-myeon to Mokhyeon-ri, Eunhae. Among them, 4.1 km from Gongni to Eosari in Seomyeon-myeon is called the West Coast Imhae Tourist Road. It is a beautiful coastal road that extends across the bay.

   Gongnipogu, a secluded fishing village at the start of the West Coast Imhae Tourist Road, welcomes you first. The wide open mudflat is peaceful just by looking at it. The fishermen who live in the open tideland are also seen. In Gongnipo-gu, there is 'Cheonsu Bay Hanul Floor' with sculptures for fishing on the roof. If you make a reservation here, you can enjoy natural fishing and cage fishing in the marine fishing park.

   It is the Sokdong Observatory with the best view of the coastal road after passing Gongnipogu. It is a beautiful view point of Cheonsu Bay and Anmyeondo Island. Originally there was only a two-story observatory on the coast, but another observatory was installed on the small island, the island, in front of the observatory. Follow the deck path from Sokdong Observatory to Moseom and climb to the top of Moseom. It is called a “Titanic Observation Deck” because it is shaped like a small boat. The tideland of Cheonsuman Bay, where seawater has escaped, is a vast land. Ganwolam can be seen in the distance, and the long Anmyeondo along Cheonsuman Bay divides the sea and the sky. In Sokdong Tidal Flat Village, a tidal flat experience is also possible when the tide is right.

   From the Eosa Intersection, take National Route 40 for about 2.5km and it is Namdang Port, famous for Daeha and the new clam. The seasonal seafood is also taking a break from tempo Han Gatjin July and August. Namdang Port, where the bustle has disappeared, is a quiet port that only passes quietly. If it's King Lee, go to the breakwater with a lighthouse that warmly surrounds Namdang Port. It is a breakwater that is large enough to have a two-lane road. When you get near the lighthouse, you can see the panoramic view of Namdang Port. Outside the breakwater, you can still see the long-lasting face and the close-up Jukdo. Jukdo Island floating in the middle of Cheonsu Bay and the orange roofs visible across the coast of Jukdo Island do not leave their eyes for a while.

   If you pass Namdang Port, you will be off the coast, but it is also the sea for a while. This time, a unique structure emerges. It is a Hongseong Embankment built on the border between Hongseong and Boryeong. On the way from Hongseong to Boryeong, there are two seawalls, which are the Hongseong Fortress that connects Seomyeon-myeon, Hongseong-gun, and Cheonbuk-myeon, Boryeong-si, and Boryeong, which connects Cheonbuk-myeon, Boryeong-si and Ocheon-myeon, Boryeong-si.
