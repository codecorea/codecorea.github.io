   The fluffy white girls of the 1930s became gray-haired grandmothers in 2019. It has been 80 years since the victims of the Japanese comfort women. Of the 238 grandmothers who were registered with the government, only 22 survived. Their average age is in their 90s. There may not be much time left. We need a place where we can better remember our grandmothers. So good news. The Japanese military comfort women's museum in Gwangju, Gyeonggi-do was newly expanded.
   <br/>
   “We must leave in history the work we did not overcome.” It was first opened in 1998 on the back of Grandmother Kim Hak-soon, the first to testify to the damage of the Japanese military 'comfort women'. Since then, in late 2017, a relic exhibition hall and memorial archives have been established. It is a memorial to the back of the sharing house, passing through the entrance where the girl's flower, which is a symbol of victims of the Japanese military 'comfort women', and the bust of grandmothers. It is a two storey building with tiled walls. The memorial building on the first floor is divided into three parts. There are grandmothers portraits in the exhibition hall, the relics of the grandmothers in the relics exhibition hall, and about 20 paintings painted by grandmothers in the paintings exhibition hall.

   There are 10 paintings side by side that are more than 1 meter wide. It is a picture of grandmothers by performing artist Poppin Hyun-joon. He said. "I painted it again with the hope that my grandmother's face would not be forgotten." Every grandmother has a different look and mood. Grandmother Park Ok-ryon of the white hair shut firmly on the date of her mouth, and Bae Choon-hee raised her mouth as if smiling. Kim Gunja grandma soon said, "Did you eat?" It's playful eyes like I'm talking. Instead of opening up their mouths to explain themselves, grandmothers spend much of their lives with expressions of lines and colors. The girl's tears dried up and became her grandmother's wrinkles. The grandmothers in the painting closed their eyes without receiving official Japanese apology.

   Kim Soon-deok says. In the exhibition hall, there are seventeen grandmothers' life histories, photographs, and items they used during their lifetime. 'Live a life together' is the title of the exhibition. It was a life where there was something more lonely than something pleasant, something more than something to remember.

    In the memorial hall, you can see the hand-printing of the victims, photos of 105 victims of domestic and foreign “comfort women” and a list of 280. It is the face of courageous accusers of Japanese war crimes. If you want to know more about the history of the Japanese military 'comfort women', you should also look around the existing history. The background of the establishment of the comfort women system, a record of activities on finding out facts, and a map showing the location of the Japanese military comfort station are arranged in detail. In the third exhibition space, there is a comfort station model with reference to victim testimony. The side room is 5 ~ 7㎡. I was upset at the moment, but I put up with it. Don't lose your composure and vow to see the historical truth.

   With a deep tingling feeling, he heads to the museum face to meet more diverse faces. Should it be like a junk or a loft that gathered all kinds of miscellaneous secrets? This is the first impression of the museum's face in Namjong-myeon, Gwangju, Gyeonggi-do. This museum is the first time. The exhibits are not organized by age or have friendly explanations. Faces sway across the times and regions. There is a picture of actor Audrey Hepburn next to the shamanism and James Dean next to the Buddha. The museum's face exhibits more than 1,000 facial sculptures, from photographs, paintings and portraits to masks, puppet and stone statues. It's a huge archive of faces. It has been collected by senior theater director Kim Jong-ok for over 50 years.

   The center of the first floor is empty. It's like a theater stage. It is the architectural intention of the director who thinks that the works of the museum are actors on the stage and wants to make a festival ground with the old people. There are colorful masks on the left wall and pictures of theatricians on the right wall. Traditional masks have a slightly different look just by the eye. Eyes that are raised uphill are biting impressions, and eyes that are gentle like downhill are sullen. Stone Buddha has nothing but a peaceful face. Actor James Dean is keen on something.

   There is no one person like Seok-in brought from each province such as Jinju-si, Gyeongnam-do, Jindo-gun, Jeonnam, and Jeju-do. Some have a serene look, while others have round eyes. It usually wears off over time and winds down, making it hard to see. What did the mason look like when he pricked stones and breathed freshly? Imagine a face hundreds of years ago. An open mouthed stoner speaks. “Don't frown like that. Don't be so happy. Then everything is washed away. ” It is comfort that only those who endure for hundreds of years can do. Those who have passed through these long and long years teach without change.
