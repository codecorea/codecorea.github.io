   On the terrace of 'Motte' next to Gana Art in Pyeongchang-dong, the picture of Bukhansan is a picture, the snow-covered trail of the 'Sunggok Tea House' in the city center is impressive, and the cafe 'Penguin' that meets after a stroll in Leeum Museum in Hannam-dong is a cake of art. A cafe tour next to an art museum suitable for winter, the more attractive you leave.

    Located on the hill road in Pyeongchang-dong, the Gana Art Center is a complex cultural space where exhibitions, performances, academies and auctions work together. In addition to the three large exhibition halls, on the 3rd floor of the building next to the Gana Art Center, which has an outdoor performance hall, there is a “cafe motte” that has been in place for 15 years. Café Motte, named after the architect who designed Gana Art, is famous for its stunning views of the terrace, thanks to its location on the foot of Bukhansan Mountain. In particular, the night view of the Pyeongchang-dong residential area from the terrace on a fall night is beautiful enough to admire it.

   Milk tea, which is not an instant tea bag, but rather an earl gray tea leaf, is popular because of its subtle, deep aroma. In winter, especially chai latte and blueberry tea, which make organic tea directly, are also popular. In the evening, there is also a wide variety of meal menus such as Pomodoro pasta, so there is always a window seat where you can enjoy the scenery at sunset.

   From Gwanghwamun Crossroads, enter the back alley of the History Museum and walk for about 10 minutes to see the Seonggok Art Museum. On the way up, you can see that there are unique cafes and restaurants, and you feel like it's not an ordinary alley. Calmness comes to the scenery of an art museum that is unbelievable that it has escaped the noise of downtown Seoul in about 10 minutes.

   Seonggok Art Museum consists of the main building, annex, memorial, sculpture park and art shop. In addition to contemporary art, it is a place where creative planning exhibitions are held across various genres such as photography, fashion, design, and video. The outdoor sculpture park created on the hill behind the art museum is 3,729㎡ wide, and over 100 trees form a forest. Along the narrow wooden walkway, works of famous domestic and foreign sculptors, such as Armand and Ku Bonju, are on display.

The Leeum Museum of Art is divided into a Korean Art Exhibition Hall, where national treasure-class artifacts such as the Geum-Dong Mi-Chang Vansang are exhibited, and a second Exhibition Hall, which displays modern and contemporary art and world modern art. The gallery walk has already begun when you see the sculpture “Tall tree and the eye” that you encounter outside the museum and enter the entrance to the artistic museum.

    Above all, we focus on desserts that go well with coffee, and in addition to carrot cakes and cheesecakes, we present new cakes every month. The strawberry latte, which was developed by making strawberry jam, is also a popular menu. After walking around the museum, if you can afford to taste even a piece of homemade cake in a cup of warm cafe latte with a more relaxed sensibility, there is no other luxury in the city center. Parking is available, closed on holidays, and business hours are from 10 am to 10 pm.
