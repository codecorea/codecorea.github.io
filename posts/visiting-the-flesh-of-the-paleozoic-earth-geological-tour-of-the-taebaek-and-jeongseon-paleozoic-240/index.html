   Geological history of 470 million years ago, Taebaek Paleozoic Natural History Museum
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Taebaek is an old land. The place that clearly proves this is the Taebaek Paleozoic Natural History Museum and the area of the parliament designated as Natural Monument No. 417. Surprisingly, around the Taebaek Paleozoic Natural History Museum, 12 strata structures showing paleozoic sediments and biological environments are randomly distributed. It is said that this area, about 600m above sea level, was the sea near the equator during the Paleozoic Era. Evidence of this can be found everywhere.

   It seems no wonder that the Paleozoic Natural History Museum was built here, where traces of strata still exist, from 470 million to 450 million years ago. Before looking at the Paleozoic terrain and geology scattered around the site, it is the first step to take a tour of the museum. The museum commentator's explanation is kind to the traveler who is not good at geology.

    The Taebaek Paleozoic Natural History Museum is a specialty museum with the theme of Paleozoic era. It is not a boring museum that conveys only hard knowledge, but a living museum where you can experience the geology of the Paleozoic era while exploring the museum and its surroundings. Through an on-site experience with a commentary, you can see and feel the traces of the Paleozoic sea environment and marine life scattered around the museum.

   The first floor of the museum is an experience exhibition room. It is composed of various learning rooms that visitors can experience directly. Experiential learning is possible through play such as takbon, chromakey and fossil excavation. In the exhibition room on the 2nd floor, you can observe the pre-cambrian period, the electricity and the middle Paleozoic strata and various biomes. In addition, you will encounter the caves of Taebaek and the use of limestone, the fossil world, and the trilobite fossil. Finally, in the exhibition room on the 3rd floor, you can examine various flora and fauna of the late Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras and feel the nature of Taebaek and the seriousness of global warming.

    After a 10-minute walk from the museum, you can encounter a variety of sedimentary structures that can observe the distribution and inconsistency of strata from the Precambrian to the Upper Paleozoic. It can be observed that the hydrochloric acid handed out from the museum is sprinkled lightly on this limestone zone. In addition, it is possible to observe various fossils such as trilobites, brachiopods, gastropods, and stromatolites, as well as sedimentary structures such as wave marks, salt marks, and snow structures that can determine the upper and lower structures of the Paleozoic era. This area, which tells the mystery of earth's history as well as its geological value, has been designated and protected as a natural monument.
    <br/>
    When you see the Paleozoic strata and fossils with your own eyes and touch them and listen carefully to the explanations of the commentators, you can feel the modern self standing on the Paleozoic strata.

    The sideways phrase is a bonus. Water from the Hwangji, the birthplace of the Nakdong River, reached here and passed through rocks, creating large stone gates and cows. What used to be called “hole cow” in the sense of a river with a hole in it became “gate station”. The river flows through the mountain, so it is sometimes called ‘Turunae’.

   If you run 30 ~ 40 minutes by car from Guseongso, you will see Geomryongso. There is a legend that Geomryongso was the origin of the Han River and stayed back on the Han River to become a dragon that lived in the West Sea. Through the limestone, the groundwater rises 2,000 to 3,000 tons per day. If you are looking at the serene Geomryongso, you may be wondering if the water is coming from here.

    If you can't afford to go to the Jeongseon Hwaam Cave, take a sip of Hwaam Mineral Water and take a walk on a light autumnal path. It is said that Hwaam Mineral Water, which is characterized by its spicy taste, contains nine elements that are good for the body such as carbonate ions, iron, calcium, and fluoride, and is effective for gastrointestinal diseases, eye diseases, and skin diseases. Even if there is not much dissolution per day, people who want to drink mineral water always have long lines. Body-friendly water is sweet in your mouth.
