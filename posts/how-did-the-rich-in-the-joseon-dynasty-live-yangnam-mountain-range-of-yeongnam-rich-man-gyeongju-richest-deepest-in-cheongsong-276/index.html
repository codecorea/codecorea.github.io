<title>How did the rich in the Joseon Dynasty live? Yangnam mountain range of Yeongnam rich man &#39;Gyeongju richest &amp; deepest in Cheongsong&#39; - Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, Korea</title>





<meta name="description" content="In the Joseon Dynasty, the rich man (in Yeongnam Province) was called &#39;Manseokman&#39;. I&#39;m a full-timer. Grain Bay is a horse that is rich with rice fields that are about to be harvested. Stones and islands can be viewed in the same unit. Even if it is not necessarily full, it means that it is rich. As a modern person living in the age of cash, I wonder. How rich is it now? For easy calculation, let&#39;s hit an island of rice with a bale. One bale weighs 80 kg. Currently, if the price of rice is about 20,000 won at about 20 kg, one bale is 200,000 won. It is 200,000 won on an island, so if it is an island, it is 2 billion won. If one island of rice (180 liters) is hit with two bales, the value is even higher. In other words, when converting Manseok-man in modern times, it means the rich with the lowest annual income of over 2 billion won. Manseokman is so rich in radishes, and the mind that looked a little shallow disappears like snow in the spring sun. Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, Korea. Korea Tour">

    In the Joseon Dynasty, the rich man (in Yeongnam Province) was called 'Manseokman'. I'm a full-timer. Grain Bay is a horse that is rich with rice fields that are about to be harvested. Stones and islands can be viewed in the same unit. Even if it is not necessarily full, it means that it is rich. As a modern person living in the age of cash, I wonder. How rich is it now? For easy calculation, let's hit an island of rice with a bale. One bale weighs 80 kg. Currently, if the price of rice is about 20,000 won at about 20 kg, one bale is 200,000 won. It is 200,000 won on an island, so if it is an island, it is 2 billion won. If one island of rice (180 liters) is hit with two bales, the value is even higher. In other words, when converting Manseok-man in modern times, it means the rich with the lowest annual income of over 2 billion won. Manseokman is so rich in radishes, and the mind that looked a little shallow disappears like snow in the spring sun.

    According to Man Seok-man, the annual salary, it is almost 100 times the amount of workers now. Moreover, given that it was a time when even eating full was considered a luxury, 'Manseokman' would have been very rich. If you dare to compare, it might be the total number of large companies now. I'm curious about this. Where and how did the rich people live in the old days? Why don't we visit the residence of the sign that represents Yeongnam in the Joseon Dynasty, the richest of the Gyeongju and the deepest of Cheongsong, and examine the living spaces of those who were considered the richest of the Joseon Dynasty?

    Gyeongju is often known only as the royal family of Silla. Since it was the only capital of Silla for a thousand years, it is also true that Gyeongju and Silla cannot be separated. However, Gyeongju does not have only Silla. Since the millennium of Silla, a new millennium has been lived in 'Koryo', 'Chosun' and 'South Korea', so Gyeongju has a longer time in other eras than 'Silla'. Of course, the aura of Gyeongju, which occupied the 'Kingdom' all the time during the Han Dynasty, is clearly different from the 'Gyeongju', which was chosen by other times.

    Gyeongju, which we will look at today, is Choi's old house in Gyo-dong, Gyeongju. It is a space more famous as 'Gyeongju Choibujapjija' than real name. Gyeongju Choi Bu-jak, who is considered to be the representative of Yeongnam Manseok-gun along with Cheongsong's rich man, is famous for being 'the rich man who has been in his twenties for over 300 years,' but it is more meaningful in that he practiced 'Noblesse Oblige'. Let's go to Gyeongju Gyodong.

   It is known that the space where Choi's closet, Gyeongju Choi's rich house is located, was the site of Yoseokgung Palace, the residence of Yoseok Princess in the Silla period. It was said to have been built around 1700 and maintained wealth for over 300 years in 12 generations. It was built in ninety-nine squares, but in 1970, Sarangchae and Byeoldang were burned down. Still, it has great value because it preserves the original form of the Joseon Dynasty.

   One of the richest is Choi Jinlip. The 2nd Choi Dong-ryang inherits a lot of property and purchases large land.

   Was it because of the good deeds of the richest man who said, 'Let there be no one who is starving in white berry'? Even in the flames of the living party, Choi Bu-jak survives. However, when he reached the twelveth-century Choi Jun and took the country to Japan, he gave his wealth to the independent funding with the belief that there would be no rich without a country. After independence, donate all the wealth to the education project. That is why the richest man ended in his twenties and 300 years.

   It is a wall built between a large Sarangchae and Anchae, which is purposefully made so that it cannot be easily seen from Sarangchae when girls and women living in the Anchae pass through the gate. You can get a glimpse of the life of a woman in a unique Confucian society and the Joseon Dynasty.

   In Anchae, the hostess and children stayed. In the large Sarangchae, the outside man was staying, but there is a slight difference in the floor height of the space where the grandfather, father, and son stayed. A smirkful laugh is mingled with the cough of the alumni who were 'hem' in the story of 툇 maru, a thankful means to move from Sarangchae to Anchae.

   The situation at the time of Confucian society is drawn. Also add a small hole in the fence of the main building. It's a 'breath hole' for girls. Through this, I watched the outside world. After passing through the side door of Sarangchae, a villa appears. This is the space where my daughter's time to marry was staying.

    Although the day is cold, after looking around the Songso old house, I dream of 'one night at the old house'. Lying on a warm lower throat, passing through Sotdaedaemun, seeing Sarangchae, and looking around Anchae and taking a round to the villa, the ninety-nine houses of the richest in the Joseon Dynasty are drawn at a glance. It's a bonus to imagine as if you were rich at the time. You can visit the old house without staying.
