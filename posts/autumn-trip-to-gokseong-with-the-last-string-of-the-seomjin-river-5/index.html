    What is love? How long has humanity wandered in search of “it” that is invisible and untouched? Doesn't everyone have their own love. Here is a man trapped in a long love. Hong Bin (Lee Dong-wook) is the hero of the drama &lt;Iron Man&gt; on KBS-2TV. Hongbin is having a long time with Kim Tae-hee (Han Eun-jung), the daughter of a stationery shop who first met her. We are still waiting for our first love, whose life and death are unknown. Then one day, a spear appears in front of him called Taehee. Hong Bin, who didn't even know the life of his first love, leaves with his son, Chang, to the hometown of Tae-hee, whose fish smells like watermelon. Oji village in Seomjin river and Jirisan, Gokseong, Jeonnam.

   Gokseong with Seomjin River and Jirisan Mountain. The tea comes from the name 'Valley' village. In fact, Gokseong is a mountain village with stems of Seomjin and Boseong rivers. Due to this natural condition, Gokseong, which was considered as an underdeveloped area, began to emerge as a tourist attraction because of the nature, Seomjin and Boseong rivers. In addition, 'Gokseong Seomjin River Train Village' and 'Sumjin River Rail Bike', which were made by utilizing the Jeolla Line, which was closed, added explosive power.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The reason why I found the song this time was to meet Seomjin River Joolbae in the drama. Was it because of the dignity of the scene of crossing the river that was spraying and visiting Taehee's hometown of first love? Thanks to some hints from the drama, the place was reduced to Seomjin River. In addition, Seomjin river rope boat was only difficult to find because it remained only in Gokseong.

   The rope boat, as its name implies, is a boat that crosses both sides of the river and pulls the rope. Expectations were added that if it was a deep mountainous area where you could rely on a ropeboat instead of overflowing tourist spots and overflowing people, you could rest there. Seomjin River rope boat connects Seokjin Village and Hogok Village with a stream of water in between.

When traveling by car, you can type ‘slump garden’ into the navigation, park it on the ground and cross the street. You will see the bus stop right away.

   For the villagers of Hogok village, the worship is life. It is really useful to reach the bus stop just across the river by boat. Wait a minute here, and wonder why the only ropeboat left on the stem of Seomjin River, which is over 500 Li, remains here in Gokseong. Simple. Gokseong itself is a valley surrounded by Seomjin River, Boseong River, and Jirisan Mountain, and Hogok Village, located across from Seomjin River, is a real Oji village. There were also fewer residents, so there were no bridges, and a real life rope was left.

   Now that you've watched the ropes, let's look around the stems of Seomjin River. At Seokchi Station, you can enjoy rail bikes using the closed section of Jeolla Line. A rail extends along the stem of Seomjin River. It is more popular with young people because it can see the bare skin of Seomjin River more dynamically.
