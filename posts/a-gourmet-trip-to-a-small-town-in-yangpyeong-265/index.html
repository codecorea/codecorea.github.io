   Ginsburg, honest bread taste without greed
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Even in Yangpyeong, it was purely this small bakery that first turned to Munjong-ri, Seojong-myeon. Ginsburg's unique bakery. The words 'no butter, no milk, no sugar' on the signboard caught my eye. When you visit Ginsburg on the morning of the weekend, you will often encounter the scenery where residents of Munho-ri come together to enjoy a cup of coffee with delicious bread. In Munho-ri, where many “semi-urbans” want to enjoy their rural life while commuting to Seoul, Ginsburg is playing a role in the neighborhood love room. On the morning of the weekend, people and locals who come to taste the bread in the countryside mix variously in this small bakery.

  <div class="txt_p">
   The history of a young male boss, who worked as a marketer in Tokyo, Japan, entered a small town in Yangpyeong and produced a natural yeast bakery, is unique. Because only a few kinds of bread are baked in small portions a day, it is easy to stir up a little late on the weekends. Some people have tried 3 or 4 or 7 to eat Ginsburg's bread. President Ginsburg, who uses natural yeast instead of yeast to make only a fixed amount per day, seems greedy. We open the store door only five days a week (Wednesday to Sunday) and close it early if the bread is sold out. Where is that? In the winter, he dares to close the door for a month or two and then travels. It is closed this year from the end of January to February 28th. So if you want to visit Ginsburg, you have to wait until March 1st.
