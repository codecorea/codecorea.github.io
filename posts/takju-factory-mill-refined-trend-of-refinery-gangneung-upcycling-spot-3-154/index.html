   'Gangneung' beer, willow brewery at the old Takju brewery
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   First, I visited the Takju factory, which has transformed into a chic Brewery. In short, it is 'Bird Tree Brewery', one of the best hot places in Gangneung. This is the third visit in the past two months. It's a frequent visit that the employee asks, "Are you Gangneung?" I enjoyed the willow brewery leisurely with good timing. The third visit was on the Saturday of July, which entered the summer. I was anxious. I rolled my own hair. 'There will be few people who are looking for a Mack house from the early afternoon of Saturday.' However, the expectations were wrong. From Saturday afternoon, McDuck (beer Deokhoo) and travelers were filling the store. We realized the popularity of willow brewery and waited for a while before we settled inside.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The reason why we frequent the willow brewery, which is not close, is simple. The atmosphere is good and the beer tastes good. The biggest attraction of the willow brewery is that the elements that are unlikely to match are nicely harmonized.

   The Gangneung Takju factory, which had been closed by students from Susuboria Academy, a brewing educational institution co-founded by Gyeonggi University and the Agricultural Technology Commercialization Foundation, was transformed into a beer brewery in 2015. In the space where fermented rice wine was fermented, beer is now ripening deliciously. The transformation from makgeolli to beer does not completely exclude Korean colors. Here, extremely Korean, 'Gangneung' beer is made.

   I drank a glass of beer, so driving is prohibited. Find a place to go on foot. We steamed the neighborhood Myeongju-dong next to Hongje-dong, where Willow Brewery is located. I had to go once before, and I always headed for the sea. This time I decided to head to Myeongju-dong. Myeongju-dong was once a downtown area of Gangneung, but now it has become a secluded old city center. The moment I entered the alley, I realized. After all, the power of time cannot be ignored. The traces and stories that the years have accumulated silently captured the stranger's footsteps at one point. Myeongju Sarangchae, a small performance hall, and a few cute cafes were seen. Someone might say, 'Is this all?' It was good not to overdo it like alleys, which are hot places in Seoul, so the slow speed of the old alleys remained true.

The name 'Bongbong Mill' is painted on a building with a pointed roof.

   Like the name, this was a real mill. It was once a place where people lined up and made rice cakes. In the course of the years, the mill was closed and left as an empty house for more than 10 years, and then in 2010, it made connections with people in the field of culture and art. After a year of manual space, the bonbong mill was opened in 2011, where coffee, culture and art and people coexist.

   I was immersed in the charm of Gangneung's upcycling spaces. He shouted 'one more place for my best friend' and went to Chodang-dong, famous for Sundang tofu. I only went to eat Champon Sundubu and Chodang Sundubu, but today I head to the rice mill instead of the restaurant. Enter the side street slightly from Chodang Sundubu Village lined with restaurants. As we walk along the alleys of a cozy neighborhood, we see a shabby building with a wooden signboard called 'chodangjeongmiso'. Stop walking there where time has stopped.

Although it has been transformed into a cafe, there are traces of it all over the place that you don't want to forget that this place was a refinery.

In the days when food production was a national task, and during the time when rice paddies were built to fill the surroundings of Gyeongpo Lake, the Chodangjeongso was an important space for cultivating rice in this town.

    The cafe is not finished just because the traces of the refinery remain. There are savory coffees and various drinks here. Also, the menu utilizing local characteristics of Chodang Sundubu Village is also noticeable. Chodang tofu banana smoothie, condibi cookie, condibi pound cake It is a menu created by the owner who runs the Chodang Sundubu restaurant nearby. It's a meeting between bean cake, cookies and pound cake ... . I can't imagine the taste of the combination. In this case, try eating it yourself. The savory and plain taste is attractive.
