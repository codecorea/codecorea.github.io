    In Gwacheon, which is connected to Yangjae-dong in Seoul, there are many museums with experiences. Master Chusa is a Chusa museum where you can meet Kim Jeong-hee's life and calligraphy works. It is excellent as an experiential learning center because you can listen to the explanations of the cultural commentators and experience calligraphy.

    The name Chusa Kim Jeong-hee (1786 ~ 1856) is widely known so that no one knows it, but his life is overshadowed by a large family called “chussa”. In addition to the basic typeface of calligraphy, such as calligraphy, Jeonseo, Chaseo, Haeseo, and Haeseo, especially Chusa is Kim Jung-hee's font. It is a typeface that feels like a picture because the strokes of different thickness and the letters that seem to be distorted are unprecedented.
    <br/>
    Chusa became a name for the Qing Dynasty in exchange for Geumseokhak and left numerous calligraphy works while interacting with literary and monks of his day. That's why you can find a lot of letters of Chusa at national sites and historical sites.

   While staying in Yanqing, he was influenced by the ties of priests such as Ongbanggang and Wanwon, which were regarded as masters of Geumseokhak. Afterwards, Chusa was devoted to Geumseokhak, revealing that the monument of Bukhansan, which was known to be founded by Ambassador Muhak, is a royal palace of Jinheung in the Silla period.

    Afterwards, he went on to official office and served as the ambassador of Sungkyunkwan Gwan. In 1840, he was implicated in the prison of Yoon Sang-do and went to exile. It is known that the Chusa was completed during the 8-year exile in Jeju.

   Next to the model of the exile in Seogwipo, there is a long line of &lt;Sehando&gt;, which is also included in textbooks. The story that &lt;Sehando&gt; was drawn on is also special. &lt;Sehan Do&gt; is a gift to Lee, an ideal student who was a student during the exile in Jeju. The ideal is an interpreter who came and went to the Qing Dynasty, and was unable to escape from the exile. Chusa wrote the phrase “Sehan Yeon-fuji Song Baekji-jojo (나오는 然後 知 松柏 之後 凋)” in “The Korean Language”, putting an eye on the ideal mind that sends a difficult-to-get book to himself. It means that it is only in winter that pine trees and pine trees do not wither. It is a pictorial representation that thanks to a difficult situation, I came to appreciate it.

   &lt;Sehando&gt;, as we know it, is a picture, but in fact, long prestigious lines continue to the side of &lt;Sehando&gt;, which are several meters in length. The ideal, which received &lt;Sehando&gt; as a gift, was shown to people of the Qing Dynasty, and those who saw the painting wrote the impression.

    Another exhibit that catches the eye in the exhibition room is the lump from Bongeunsa Temple. It is a shorthand written 'Panjeon (板 展)', which is a reproduction of Jang Kyung-gak of Bongeunsa Temple in Gangnam-gu, Seoul. Invisible in Chusa's writing, it seems to be written by a beginner who has just started learning calligraphy. What is the reason why you can't see any trick or fashion and feel pure? The seven letters on the left side wash away the curiosity. “The Seventy-Old Water Squad (七十 一 壽 病 中 作)”. Chusa, meaning “write in the age of seventy years old,” wrote two letters of “convenience,” and died four days later. He was willing to sit up and hold a brush with his body facing death.
    <br/>
    At the end of the exhibition room, there is a space where you can watch the video of Chusa's life and work, and sit back and take a moment to re-examine Chusa's life.
