   There is a new trip to enjoy Namdo. The main character is the 'Namdo Marine Train (S-train)', which connects Yeonghonam from Busan to Boseong. Let's enjoy the rich Namdo Island trip by getting on the Namdo Marine Train, which started operating in September 2013.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   There are numerous ways to travel to Namdo. Starting with ‘Taste and Fashion’, which is almost the same level as Namdo, it is a breeze. Filled with open fields, seas, and abundance of tidal flats, Namdo has plenty of fun to enjoy. Maybe that's why people have fantasies about Namdo.

   Thanks to you, the trip to Namdo, which encompasses Yeonghonam on the Korean Peninsula, is a trip that would have been a dream for anyone who likes to travel. However, if you were to leave, there were a lot of things to take care of, so there might have been some who couldn't put it into practice. Introduce for them. Another way to travel South Island! Namdo Marine Train (S-train) is the main character.

   First of all, even if you don't have to add ‘travel’, the train will naturally travel as soon as you get on the ‘train’. The experience of becoming a “trip” even when traveling to a destination is a bonus that can be enjoyed when choosing a train. The memories of eggs and ciders boiled as a child turned into lunch boxes and various streets, but the train's unique characteristics remain the same. Maybe that's why people still look for trains. “Namdo” has been added to this, so the ears are soft.

   Next, let's look at the operation section of the S-train. The starting points are Busan and Boseong. The train departing from Busan every day at 8:25 am passes through Changwon Central, Masan, Jinju, and Hadong and enters Honam. Before long, it took about 4 hours to run through Suncheon to Boseong. The train from Boseong to Busan departs at 5pm every day. Train times are subject to change, so be sure to check in advance. The fee is 2,500 won per adult one way.

   When you hear the name ‘Namdo Marine Train (S-train)’, it seems like a train trip along the sea of Namdo will take place, but in fact, you will face more of the inland and the stream of Namdo. It is longer to face the ridge of the Seomjin River, which divides the stem of the Nakdong River and the Honam of Yeongnam. Trains from Busan do not reach the sea until they arrive at Yeosu. It is difficult to misunderstand the train that runs along the beautiful South Sea after hearing only the name of the ‘marine train’. An official from the Korea Railroad Corporation said, “As you can see when riding a train, the“ Namdo Marine Train ”goes better than the name of the“ Namdo Marine Train ”because it meets more river stalks than the sea.“ The Namdo Marine Train connects Busan, Boseong and the rich Yeonghonam. I hope you can feel the essence of your trip to Namdo on a ride. ”

   Then, what is the most beautiful section of the Namdo Marine Train? Kim Yong-ok, deputy general manager of the Korea Railroad's Southeast Area Tourism Belt Promotion Team, selected the section that touches the stem of the Nakdong River and the Seomjin River of Hadong at the first hand. You don't need to remember all the scenery on the train, but how about remembering these two sections? If you are on a train trip with a good person, this is a good place to whisper sweetly.

    The train departing from Busan Station at 8: 5 am passes Gupo ~ Changwon Jungang ~ Masan ~ Jinju ~ Bukcheon ~ Hadong ~ Suncheon ~ Beolgyo ~ Deukryang and reaches Boseong. The train from Boseong to Busan leaves at 5pm. If you take the train connecting Seoul and Yeosu Expo, you can get on the Namdo Ocean Train from 'Suncheon'. This means that it is also possible to travel from Yeosu to Suncheon off the Namdo Marine Train. Checking out the day trip products for the Namdo Ocean Train, such as Yeosu, Boseong, Suncheon, and Hadong, introduced by KORAIL will help you make a great trip. Namdo Marine Train Busan to Boseong One-way fare 2,500 won, Busan to Suncheon one-way fare 2,500 won.
