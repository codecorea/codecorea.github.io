    There was a boy who was very curious about machines as a child.

   Even if you enter, the children rarely take a step. This is because animal friends in the fairy tale such as hippopotamus, wolf, raccoon, monkey, and rabbit give a welcome greeting. This time, the faces of the mother and daughter are full of smiles. Robots are exclusively owned by men, and girls are not interested. However, animals with funny and funny expressions are the characters that girls like.

   Art Gallery O was decorated with the works of Oh Dae-ho, who combined art and science with the theme of space and global environment. It has a fairy tale country and a robot land, and consists of eco art that emphasizes the importance of the environment, and media art that uses sound and video. It is a space reflecting the artist's philosophy of "If not experienced, it is not art".

   There are tanks and spaceships at the entrance to the gallery. Tanks and spacecraft that were elaborately made from scraps were allowed to climb directly. What is curious is that the tank turret rotates and the spacecraft moves. It is a work tailored to the eye level of a little spectator who is not satisfied with just looking. Children on a moving tank like it without a hitch on an unexpected windfall. On the wall of the gallery, horses fly in the sky and colorful salmon dance. Next to it, a dove symbolizing peace is flying in line.

   'Gulver Travel Plane' expresses Gulliver, which is tied to a rope by drifting to a small country, and has fun features hidden in each character. There are kings and queens of small countries, some who shoot bows, some who climb ladders. 'Snow White' expressed the scene where she fell down after eating the apple given by Queen Witch. Abandoned apples are laid out in a bunch, while a witch is hiding behind a tree in the forest and watching. It is fun to find the fairy tale descriptions that are easy to pass by, as if looking for treasure.

   A typical experience at Fun Park is math experience. This is an educational method that allows you to naturally interact with mathematics while touching and listening with a tool through mathematics play experience learning that combines amusement with math. The entrance to the mathematics experience center is paid, and you can watch it once a day three times a day (11:00, 14:00, 16:00) while listening to the curator's explanation.

   Even if you don't have an experience center, you can enjoy a free math experience at the outdoor experience center. Leonardo Da Vinci's bridge is made without connecting parts such as nails. You will understand the spatial shape by touching and looking at how the wood is connected to each other.
