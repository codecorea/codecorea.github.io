   A short walk from the Wolchulsan Tea Garden reveals the Baekdong Garden, a historic traditional annex in Honam. In the meaning of 'the village where the water flowing from Wolchulsan rises to become a cloud', the outstanding beauty is conveyed through &lt;Baekdongdo Island&gt; where Dasan Jeong Yak-yong and Choui-seon each wrote poems and painted.
