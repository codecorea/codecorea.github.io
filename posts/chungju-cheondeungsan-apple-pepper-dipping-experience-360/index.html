    Cheondeungsan Traditional Miso, Chungju-si, Chungcheongbuk-do, is known for its traditional Korean soybean paste, red pepper paste, and organic soy sauce. Soy sauce, which is soaked in the traditional way without adding chemical seasonings or pigments, is highly praised by regular customers across the country. There are people who buy the amount to eat for a year and put it in a jar on the farm, and then take it a little and eat it.
   </p>

  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    The young and old Kim Young-ja, who lived in the city of Chungju, took home at the foot of Cheondeungsan Mountain 13 years ago. In a natural environment with good water and good air, her husband farmed apples, and his wife began to soak miso and red pepper paste using the skills he inherited from his mother. When he was over fifty, he dreamed that he would live with soybean paste and red pepper paste.
    <br/>
    At first, the amount of soaking and sharing with acquaintances began to increase year by year, and it was even sold. As more and more people asked for their secrets, they started operating a chapter making workshop.

    “My husband is very good at apple farming. Chungju apples taste really good. So I was thinking about how to use an apple when soaking it, and then I developed an apple pepper paste. ”
    <br/>
    Chungju, which has a large daily cross-section and rich sunshine, has a reputation for producing apples that taste better than any other region. Chungju apple, which is rich in juice and sweet, meets with red pepper powder to create a unique hot pepper paste with a spicy taste. In particular, it is said that it is enough to taste the food that is heated, such as stir-fried octopus or tteokbokki.

   Ingredients for apple pepper paste are surprisingly simple. Red pepper powder, malt, salt, and salt are the same as regular red pepper paste. To this, boiled apples and concentrated apple water are added. It is important to keep in mind the proportion of each ingredient.

    In the excitement of soaking red pepper paste for the first time in life, young mothers and dads unfamiliar with kitchen work wear aprons without hesitation. For children who do not eat spicy food, it is a special experience to make apple pepper paste. Stir in the spatula with the red pepper powder that tickles the tip of the nose. I'm going to make delicious Tteokbokki with my own red pepper paste. It was said that the first taste was jeongseong. You need to stir evenly, giving strength to the hand holding the spatula.

   When you return after completing an hour's visit to the village, the color of apple peppers made by experienced visitors is quite different. When the ingredients were only mixed with a spatula, they were slightly thin and light in color, while the concentration became thicker and the red color became darker. You can take well-made gochujang in a glass bottle. You can put it in the refrigerator immediately after taking it home and eat it after 2 weeks.
