   It's warmer than usual, saying 'Dong-gun disappeared'. If you don't want to spend a season without a change of memories, let's go to Chongyang where Chilgapsan is where winter is more enjoyable than summer when Anakne's Baeksam is soaked.

   Just look at it! Ceiling arc bridge
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   How would you feel standing on a rocking bridge that is 207 meters long and 1.5 meters wide? Located at the tip of Chilgapsan Mountain, you can enjoy the thrill of the trekking all over with the luck of seeing the world's largest peppers and goji berry. Cheongyang Chilgapsan Cheolho Lake is the longest boasting bridge in Korea.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   After the completion of 2009, an entertainment program visited and became a specialty of Cheongyang. At the beginning of this place, the bean field hawk, which appears in the song `` Chilapsan, '' greets us by stealing a hoe on one hand and a sweat flowing from the other. When you walked while appreciating the hearts of mothers during difficult times, you can face the ceiling of the ceiling. I am overwhelmed by the longer bridge than I thought, the picturesque ceiling, and the giant tower of 16m in size.

   But the real pleasure to find here is the rocky bridge! The ceiling arc rocking bridge is designed to swing about 30 ~ 40cm. It's a bit more recoil than you'd expect to go on a tightrope, and you'll grasp the handle tightly. If you have less than you think, stop and look down. Looking down the ceiling of the middle of the bridge adds to the breathtaking feeling. Even if you want to enjoy more thrills, don't let them stumble for safety.

   Unlike other villages where there are many summer experiences, people visit here in winter. Alpine villages are not only steep, but also looking north, so rivers do not have sun all day. The temperature is also 3-4 degrees lower than other regions, making it vulnerable to farming. The locals, however, created a festival in which the poor natural environment was transformed into the best gift. The ice fountain is used as an ice fountain festival, and a sloped mountain is used as a sledding slope. Instead, it is an ice fountain festival where you can fully feel the countryside.

   Observations take place in the main and secondary observation rooms on the third floor. In the observation room where the largest refractor is installed in Korea, sunspots and irises are observed. The secondary observation room, designed as a hemispherical sliding dome that surrounds the main observation room, observes the objects in the night sky such as planets, nebulae, and clusters at night. The astronomical projection room, where you can project constellations and celestial objects by projecting a virtual object like a real night sky on a 10m dome screen, is by far the most popular program that embodies the mystery of the universe in the hearts of children.
