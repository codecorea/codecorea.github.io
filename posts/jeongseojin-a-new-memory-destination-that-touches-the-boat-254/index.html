    The end is strangely connected with memories. On the extension line of the familiar space, 'the end' creates vague memories. Gangdong's Jeong Dong-jin has long since become a pronoun for making memories, and Jang Heung's Nampo Village's Jeong Nam-jin has also been covered with the story behind the movie &lt;Festival&gt;, increasing the number of people. A new memory spot was created not far from Seoul. This is Jeong Seo-jin, Seo-gu, Incheon.

   <p>
    Jeong Dong-jin and Jeong Nam-jin mean a seaside narrator located in the east and south of the country, starting from Gwanghwamun, Seoul, where former kings lived. Therefore, Jeong Seojin is the end of the Gwanghwamun and the narrator. Jeongseojin coincides with Gwanghwamun's road sign, latitude 37 degrees 34 minutes 08 seconds, toward the west side, and is exactly 34.526 km from Gwanghwamun.

    You may be wondering that Jeong Seo-jin's story has been rising recently. Jeong Seo-jin is connected to the starting point of Gyeongin Ara Waterway. It is a tourist attraction discovered in Seo-gu, Incheon since 2011 in connection with the opening of Gyeongin Ara Waterway. If Jeongdongjin is filled with train stations and wide sandy beaches, and Jeongnamjin has a strong outlook of a secluded fishing village, Jeongseojin looks somewhat unfamiliar with a boat gate and passenger terminal.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   If you arrive at Jeong Seo-jin in anticipation of your vague muzzle level, the atmosphere of the neatly refurbished surroundings will approach you. The wind turbines rotating round and round, towering observation decks, and museums that have been remodeled for retirement traps are the first to catch the eye. Below the Yeongjongdaegyo Bridge, the tidal flat spreads out smoothly, and the plane floats and descends over Yeongjongdo. The milestone that informs Jeong Seo-jin is somewhat in between.

    The fact that Jeong Seo-jin is still less known in the world can be experienced in local people's message. Even the employees at work and those who came to ride a bicycle on the Arabaetgil have a strange expression on the presence and symbol of Jeong Seo-jin.

   The symbolic sculpture of Jeong Seo-jin, who encounters in a large space with a mixture of a square and a marina, is a sunset shaped like a white stone. Noeuljong takes the form of a pebble created by the high and low tide on the west coast. You can see the sunset between the sunset and the sunset when the tide spreads, but this sunset has the meaning of “start” rather than “the end”.

   The sunset wall is next to the sunset. The outdoor wall, hanging from a small piece of paper, is an experience space where visitors to Jeongseojin carve memories and new departures.

   Love Story in Jeong Seojin

  <div class="txt_p">
   Jeong Seo-jin's added luck is not only the geographical location, but also the story behind it. Jeong Seo-jin was called 'Jang Moru' in the Goryeo Dynasty. Travelers from the southern region to Gaekyung, the royal road of Goryeo, stayed for a day. At that time, the legend that the son of a grand daughter living in Jeolla-do stayed here in Yeogak (ryokan) as he went to see the past. Based on this legend, Seo-gu Office in Incheon recommends using Jeong Seo-jin as a couple's proposal space or a place to swear love.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Even if you can't see the sunset, there are quite a few places to swear love. Next to the plaza, a wooden deck walkway is formed along the waterway, and beside it, the wind power generator runs beautifully. The Ara Tower observatory overlooks the Arabaetgil and Yeongjongdo tidal flats at a glance.
