   In early April, cherry blossoms embroider the causeway, and at the end of April, the newly renovated Suncheon Bay Garden opens on the road. Nevertheless, if the spring day is in a hurry, you may want to comfort the plum blossoms of Geumdunsa and Seonamsa in March.

   The thrill of springtime is everywhere. It's a season when you pretend you couldn't win and leave yourself in the landscape. At this time, the film &lt;Story of April&gt; by Junji Iwai comes to mind. This work full of excitement in springtime has many elements that evoke vague memories such as first love and bookstore. One of the most impressive scenes was the protagonist Uzuki riding a bicycle over a cherry blossom tree. That is why I recommend a bicycle trip to lovers who have been waiting for spring. Is it just lovers? Arthur Conan Doyle, a British mystery writer who created Sherlock Holmes, said, "When you don't even see it, drag your bike on a blind spot. Don't think about it. Just remember that you're running." So, let's fold the British drama &lt;Sherlock&gt; for a moment and enjoy the spring of the bicycle recommended by the original author.

   Suncheon is a great place for a bicycle trip on a spring day. Spring aura is full and even colorful. Cherry blossoms are in full bloom along Dongcheon across the city. Also, on April 20, the Suncheon Bay area, where the International Garden Expo was held, will open as Suncheon Bay Garden. A bicycle culture center was opened in early March. In addition, Suncheon Bay is the city that has Suncheon Bay, Nakan Eupseong, and Seonamsa Temple, which are named among the top 100 Korean tourists must visit. How do they turn away from the smell of spring they convey? Above all, the bicycle roads and infrastructure that surround them are well equipped.

   If you plan to use the same day course or public transportation, it is recommended to use Suncheon Station or Suncheon Public Terminal as a starting point. You can use your bicycle after storing your luggage in the storage box. Onnuri (bicycle) terminal where you can rent a public bicycle is only a short time after leaving the train station or the intercity bus terminal. You can rent it out on the fly through a light payment process. There are 22 terminals and 138 Onnuri bicycles in downtown Suncheon. You can return to any of the 22 terminals without having to return to your original location. However, since it cannot be used for more than 3 hours in a row, it must be reused after returning to the terminal.

Among them, 4 courses between Dongcheon and Suncheon Bay Ecological Park are fine. The distance is also 16km round trip, so it is safe to get off the road. From Dongcheon to Suncheon Bay Ecological Park, the scenery of the spring day is good, and you can also see the Suncheon Bay Garden on the road.

   It flows across the city from north to south to Suncheon Bay. From Pungdeokgyo Bridge to Dongcheon, I always run along the river. The road along the embankment is full of forsythia. It is a messenger of yellow light that knows the spring day before the light pink cherry blossom. Cherry blossoms are still early. Does that mean staying only in winter? At the end of the branches, a cautious lump looks at the spring sunshine. Probably in early April, flowers will be bloomed and the streams will be embroidered. Stepping on the pedal slowly, drawing the scenery. Warm spring chases and cool wind follows. There are also a number of people who enjoy a relaxing dream under the water willow. The fresh greens are everywhere. If you run about 3km like that, it is a 'dream bridge'. This bridge connects east and west of Suncheon Bay Garden, which is divided by Dongcheon.

   The Bridge of Dreams was created by artist Kang Ik-jung who designed the Korean Pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai Expo in China. Thirty recycling containers were connected to form a 175m long bridge. From the outside, interesting and erratic sentences such as 'Sleep when the airplane shakes' and 'School grades get worse if you treat rhinitis' are noticeable. The inside, invisible from the outside, is a dream world. Over 140,000 drawings by children from 16 countries form a bridge. The name of the bridge of dreams is new.

   Suncheon Bay Garden was the place where the Suncheon Bay International Garden Expo was held. From April 2013 to October 2013, 83 gardens in 23 countries greeted visitors for six months. The world gardens, theme gardens, and ecological gardens were abundant. It was the most spectacular show of spring 2013. This year is no different. After the event, the fairground was renovated to Suncheon Bay Garden. Beginning on April 19th, the festival will be officially opened. Suncheon Bay, a world-class garden reproducing gardens from various countries including France, the Netherlands, and China, as well as the Suncheon Bay Garden and Suncheon Bay Natural Ecological Park, as well as the Suncheon Lake Garden, created by world-class garden designer Charles Hicks inspired by the landscape of Suncheon A PRT (unmanned railroad car) is preparing for spring. Fortunately, the west gate area of Suncheon Bay Garden in the west of Dongcheon was opened ahead. Suncheon Bay International Wetland Center, Suncheon Bay WWT Wetland, Korean Garden, and Arboretum can be reviewed in advance.

The interior was decorated with exhibition halls, lecture rooms, and office spaces. Open the door and go straight to the exhibition room. In the middle is a shelter for bicyclists.

Particularly interesting is the exhibition of models that show the development of bicycles by age. There is also a celery ferry that was invented by French Countess Conte Mede de Cibrac in 1709 and pushed on two feet without a pedal, and the first pedal bike made by blacksmith Kirk Patrick McMillan in 1839. High-wheeled bicycles with large front wheels by James Staly and William Harman also attract attention. A small explanation adds to the fun of reading. Bicycle lanes were laid out on the asphalt road around the center. Light driving practice is possible.

   After leaving the bicycle center, head towards Dongcheon again. 5 ~ 6km south along the riverside will reach Suncheon Bay Natural Ecological Park. Suncheon Bay boasts an outstanding scenery that is considered as one of the '100 best Korean tours that Koreans must go to.' It is the first coastal wetland registered in the Ramsar Convention, and its natural ecological value is also exceptional. Most of all, a large tidal flat reaching 22.6 km and a reed field that fills a quarter of them is a rebirth that brings back the Suncheon Bay Natural Ecological Park. For this reason, Suncheon Bay was named as a reed destination on an autumn day. However, the springtime energy enjoyed by a bicycle trip is no less than the fall.

You can also park your bicycle for a while and climb the Yongsan Observatory. The scenery is already familiar, but whenever I come to Suncheon Bay, I walk again. The scenery where the S-shaped curved tidal road connects to the sea is still spectacular. In addition, the green reeds on the spring day contrast with the old reeds. The reed will gradually add blue color until the hot summer day. Nevertheless, if you miss the spring flowers, you can move to the east.

   There was a bicycle road to Seonamsa Temple, but using a bus is easy. Seonamsa plum blossoms are alluring enough to be called 'Seonammae'. It is not a grace of one or two years. The old plum of 300-600 years old speaks with the color and scent of the old age. Plum blossoms that stand for a long time and fall behind the original are not flowers, but other people. However, the end of March is a little early. It seems to bloom in early April.

   Instead, we recommend Geumdunsa Temple at the end of March. Jindumsa Temple wakes up from Napwol Hongmae (臘 月 紅梅). In Buddhism, the lunar new year (January) when Sakyamuni gained enlightenment is called Napwol. So, Napwol Hongmae is a plum that blooms in winter. It is the fastest time except Jeju. Is it only a lead month red hawk? More than 100 plum trees, including Cheongmae and Baekmae, fill the rustic temple. It is also a plum to open and close narrow paths. Every time you go around the corner, you're excited. It is a flower temple in itself. It is another luxury that can be enjoyed in Suncheon on a spring day.
