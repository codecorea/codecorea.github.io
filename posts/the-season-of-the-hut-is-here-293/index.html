    Cock. Before I called his name, he was just one of many fish and shellfish. However, when he calls his name, which starts from the name, “Kokmak”, born and raised in the volcanic Namdo tidal flat, turns on.

    Now that we have looked at the past festivals, let's go on a full-scale trip. No matter how ‘Beolgyo’ is ‘Kokmak’, ‘Kokmak’ is ‘Beolgyo’, but where can I taste it? In addition to Kokmak, Yangdae Mountain Mountain and Daeha Fiction &lt;Taebaek Mountain Mountain&gt;, which represent Beolgyo, cannot be overlooked. Between Suncheon and Boseong, the beolgyo, which embraces the warm tidal flats of the women's and Suncheon bays, is the actual stage of Jung Tae-rae's novel &lt;Taebaeksanmaek&gt;, which deals with the tragedy of cognitive conflict caused by ideological confrontation. It has been loved as a literary destination since. The Kokmak Festival was also held under the theme of ‘Takbaek Mountain Range Literary Tour according to the taste of Kokmak at Beolgyo’.

   right. &lt;Taebaek Mountain Range&gt; comes first if you enter the 'Bulgyo' land. In the novel, 'Kok-mak', which the bee-gyo bears, appears to stimulate the imaginative imagination. Let's take a look at &lt;Taebaek Mountain Range&gt; for a moment. The background of the novel was the year of the Yeosun incident in 1948, when the punishment of the left wing occupied the military again and was confused. It starts with a scene where left-wing secret party member Jung Ha-seop enters the punishment.

   The house of fire hydrant and Hyunbu Pines, where Jung Ha-seop was hiding, also keep their place. If you know &lt;Taebaek Mountain Range&gt;, you must be glad. The scene where the background in the novel and the movie unfolds in front of the eyes adds 'uniqueness' to the trip to beolgyo. It has a meaning of multiplicity, adding to history and culture, rather than just a travel destination. The bridges over Beolgyocheon that penetrate the town of Beolgyo greet travelers. Even looking at these ‘legs’ can make a great beolgyo trip. An iron bridge where Yeom Sang-gu competes with a double sword to take control of the fist world of punishment. The bridges I saw in the novel, such as the Buyonggyo, where many people died due to conflict between the North and the South, are hanging on the beolgyocheon.

   Buyonggyo, also known as the ‘Sohwa Bridge’, is not just a bridge. A number of people died here during the Yeosun incident and when the rebels were suppressed. Now, a new bridge that allows vehicles to pass is added. When you go upstream of the digestive bridge, you will see Honggyo (Treasure No. 304), which Yeom Sang-jin stacked up to distribute to the tenants the rice they stole. It is said that this place has a bridge made of rafts, and the place has been named “Bulgyo”. Honggyo, located on the foot of a raft bridge, was built as a stone bridge in 1729 by a draft missionary. It became the Rainbow Bridge since the bridge was repaired in 1737 (Yeongjo 13).

   Now, following the &lt;Taebaek Mountain Range&gt;, we took a tour of the history of Bolkyo, so it's time to taste it. In the novel &lt;Taebaek Mountain Range&gt;, a small cock also appears. This is a scene where the firefighter who met Jeong Ha-seop is preparing for breakfast and regrets that there is no kid, and Yeom Sang-gu compares the outsider's house to 'it looks like a winter kid'. In particular, after digesting Jeong Ha-seop, after one night, preparing for breakfast, he regrets that there is no skewer.

   It's not just that there's a true little. There is also a new style of cock called a cock of a cocky name. The wrinkles of the shell are relatively shallow compared to the true corn. Some people say that the taste is slightly deteriorated. Looking at the true and new cock, you can clearly distinguish them only by their appearance. Chamkomak is the most delicious from Chuseok to New Year's Day, but it is hard to taste chewy and firm komak until early March in spring.
