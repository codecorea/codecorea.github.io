During the Joseon Dynasty, this was often done to save grain. Alcohol was forbidden when there was a condition or severe drought caused a bad year. Yeongjo was especially strict with alcohol. It is said that Danjong (Gamju) was used instead during the rite of Jongmyo Shrine, and was ruled to be a death penalty when violating Geumjuryeong.
