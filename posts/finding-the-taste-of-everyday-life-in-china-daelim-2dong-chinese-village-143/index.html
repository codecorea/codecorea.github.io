   Usually, the residential area is quiet during the day and has a busy time during commute. However, the streets of the Chinese village in Daelim 2-dong are a little different. As more and more Chinese people live in Daelim 2-dong, Chinese merchants entered one another. As Koreans begin to visit, the day and night of Daelim 2-dong is an ordinary week.

However, whatever Chinese style is large, the texture, flavor and taste are completely different. Menus that I've never seen before are fragile. Although it looks like a tray of eggs of only one size, the bread that is cut into the shape of a pizza like a pizza, a pimento glutinous rice cake filled with glutinous rice in green peppers, and even the food with rice in thin tofu, the name and taste are unfamiliar, but there are things that you can try lightly It's very thick.

   The broth has a unique scent, and the amount of ingredients is very generous. Put the ingredients in the bath and wait until they are cooked, so you must prepare them to eat the ingredients. When ordering a hot pot, give the peanut sauce, minced green onion and coriander mixed with various seasonings. On the table is a Chinese spice, Tsuran. Tsuran is a spice made from the seeds of the apiaceae cumin. It is bitter, spicy and has a strong aroma, and it removes odor. Of these four, mix them with one that suits your taste and the sauce is complete. Coriander and Tsuran can be burdensome with their unique scent, so check the taste and scent beforehand.

   The dish that goes well with the spicy and fragrant marathon is definitely Kwabaru. Cucumbero is a Beijing-style glutinous rice soup. The sourness beyond the sour taste and the sweetness wrapped around the tongue make the mouth clean even though it is a fried dish.
