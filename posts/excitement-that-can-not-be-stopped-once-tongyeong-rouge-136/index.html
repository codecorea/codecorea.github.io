   Many people gather to sleigh in southern Tongyeong, where the spring is full of warm spring. This is to ride the Skyline Rouge, which can only be enjoyed at six locations around the world. LUGE is a playground that uses specially designed carts and tracks using only the slope and gravity of the ground without special power devices. It was first invented in Rotorua, New Zealand, and opened sixth in Tongyeong after New Zealand (2), Canada (2) and Singapore (1).

   As soon as it opened in February 2017, guests will have to wait for more than two hours on weekends. Still, Luge's popularity doesn't fade. Due to the relatively low number of visitors early in the morning or on weekdays, it is best to avoid crowded hours to relax.

   Skyline Luge is the same name as Winter Sports Luge, but much safer and easier. Think of it as a sled with a steering wheel and wheels. The operation is as simple as a sled, so children over 110 centimeters can ride alone. Children 85 to 110 cm tall must be accompanied by a guardian.

   To experience the luge, take a chairlift overlooking Mt. Miseung and Tongyeong downtown to the upper boarding area. Before riding a chairlift, you should choose a helmet that fits your head. First-time users are taught how to use simple sleds. At the boarding area, the left row is for those who have been trained in sledding and the right is for first-timers.

   Sit down with your legs straight and push the handle forward with both hands, and the sled will slowly slide forward. Release the force a little more and push the steering wheel forward to gain speed. Conversely, pulling the handle toward you slows down. Follow the instructions of the guide and confirm that you are moving and stopping the sleigh and immediately stand at the starting line.

   You have to come down with no power, so do not apply braking on the first straight course to accelerate. If you want to accelerate to some degree, S-shaped, U-shaped, 360-degree rotating course comes out. There is only one 360-degree turn course in the world, so tourists who have used the Luge from abroad may come to enjoy the new track.

   Safety guards are on the dangerous course and look low on the road, but there are barriers on both sides of the track so you don't have to worry about leaving the track. Cool spring breezes sweep their faces and the blue sea of the South Sea unfolds beneath their feet. In the beautiful scenery, joyful shouts are heard both here and there.

   Rouge track total 1.5km. It runs about 10-15km per hour and arrives in the lower station in 8-10 minutes. It seems to have ended so quickly that I sell additional tickets at the exit. One-time, three-time and five-time passes are sold, most of which are purchased at least three times. Once you get down, you can realize the meaning of "Once is never enough".

   On the first attempt, driving a sleigh is immature and it takes about 10 minutes to come down to the end when it is scared with acceleration. From the second, there are tips and confidence, and time is getting less and less. Couples who have used the luge several times are racing ahead or walking backwards. It's an amusement facility that comes first for children and later for adults.

   When planning a luge in Tongyeong, my slogan is "Ruge in the cable car land in the sky." Tongyeong's representative travel course, Hallyeo Sudo View Cable Car, and Luge Boarding Hall are well located up and down. As you ride the Tongyeong cable car, you can see the Luge boarding area under your feet. Tongyeong, where you can enjoy the sky, the land, the island and the sea, is the best place for spring travel. Enjoy a fun luge sled, then ate Tteokbokki in Seopirang village, leave for an island floating on the indigo sea, or ride a bike along the coast. Seasoned torii and Munge Bibimbap stimulate the appetite, and Tongyeong's representative foods such as jjigae, minced rice porridge, honey bread, and Chungmu Gimbap attract tourists everywhere. Things to see, Tongyeong overflowing with food is not enough for a day.
