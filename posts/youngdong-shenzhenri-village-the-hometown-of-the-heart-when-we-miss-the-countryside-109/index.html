   "I want to go back!" There are times when anyone wants to go somewhere, like the lines in a movie. At any point in the past, or anywhere in the past, there are times when you will be reminded of your memories. Especially when a big holiday is over.

   But going back in time is not easy. As time goes by, the appearance of hometown is changing. In the meantime, there are some places that retain their former appearances as if they were passing away. If you want to go back to a moment in the past, take a slow train to Shenzhen station in Yeongdong, Chungbuk.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Shenzhen Station is a small convenience station. The station was opened as a regular station in 1905. The station has been newly built and moved to Gyeongbu Line double track construction in 1934. The history of the 1930s was preserved in the original form of the gable roof and was designated as Registered Cultural Property No. 297 in 2006. When you get off at the small station, you can see the green roof and the words 'the station where the old memories stay'. There are not many people getting on the train and getting off. The scent of dull feelings abounds in history and railroad tracks. The waiting room is small too.

It was hard to imagine the bustle of the past without the guidance of a station worker in Shenzhen, who once said that it was a busy and noisy neighborhood. The neighborhood was quiet.
