   Samtan Amusement Park is located at Sancheok-myeon, Chungju-si, Chungbuk. The train to Samtan Amusement Park is good. This is because there is an amusement park about 500 meters from Samtan Station. Pass the Samtan Bridge right in front of the station and follow the road to Myeongdol Village. Samtan means three streams, such as government office, pine and barnacle. Jupocheon, which leads to the Namhan River, flows around the amusement park.

   In the past, the people were rare enough to stay with them, but in 1958 trains passing through Samtan Station were extended to form villages and amusement parks. In June 2000, a sports park was created next to the amusement park. Recently, a natural grass soccer field has been set up in the center of the park. Most of the facilities in the amusement park can be used free of charge, but lawn parks require a maintenance fee after booking.

    The malls along the funfair ramp combine restaurants, canteens and bed and breakfasts. You can rent or buy some fishing gear as well as some simple fishing gear. Every summer, residents work together to improve the environment around the park. This year, from July 16th to August 15th, an environmental information center and Saemaul Library will be run by 200 residents. The Environmental Information Center is a voluntary activity that creates a clean environment for vacationers by removing garbage and collecting recyclables around the amusement park. Saemaul Library has over 2,000 books available for free rental and leads a healthy holiday culture. Residents in charge of the river reside in preparation for safety accidents.

    Before heading home, let's go from Samtan Station to Chungju Station in time for the train. Jungang Top Park is located about 7km from Chungju Station. It is called the tower in the center of Korea. Its historical name is Joongwon Papyeong-ri Seven-storied pagoda. It is the largest stone pagoda in the Unified Shilla Era. It is currently designated as National Treasure No. 6. In 1992, a historic park was built around the pagoda, and in 2007, the park facility was built along with the reorganization and repair work around the central pagoda. Inside the park are Chungju Museum 1 and 2, an open-air museum and a music hall. A music fountain is installed on Tangeum Lake in front of the park.
