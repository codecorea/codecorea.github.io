    There is a saying that all roads in the northern Boryeong area connect with Ocheon. This is because the port of Ocheon served as the main port and military port of Boryeong in the Baekje period. Since then, Ocheon Port has become a small fishing port, but recently it has been regaining its old glory due to the clamshell. Ocheon Port occupies about 60% of the country's production, and gourmets from all over the country gather at the port. Azalea blooming is the key season in April.

   At a depth of 40m, a murmur can dig
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The Chinese characters for ‘오천’ are ‘Zara O (鰲)’ and ‘My Heaven’. The name is given because the terrain of Cheonsu Bay including Ocheon is like Zara. Since the mountain on both sides of the sea acts as a breakwater, there is no damage even in severe storms, and the depth of the water is a port of bliss, which is not at all uncomfortable for the passage of ships due to the tide.
   <br/>
   It is said to be a port, but it is small. There is no change in facilities for tourists. There is a restaurant along the beach, and you can buy your favorite seafood at the restaurant. Nevertheless, the reason to visit Ocheon Port in the spring is because it is the country's largest mountain clam.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The key clam is embedded vertically in deep sandy soil at a depth of 20-50m. It is not caught by fishing, nor is it rolled up by a net. Only people directly go into the sea and deliver them one by one. It's up to the Muzzle to pick up the keyshell. The name, unfamiliar, is the diver's short name. Refers to a person who enters seawater to catch meat or harvest seafood.
   <br/>
   The Mughly goes out to the sea in time to work. Hold the key shell while wandering in the sea for 3 hours in short and 6 hours in long. Full days are available for work. When it's saree, the water is so strong that I can't work, but only when I work a little.

   It is common for the Mook of Ocheon Port to go over 40m deep in search of a key shell. It is difficult and dangerous, but it is inevitable because the key shell is the money that supports life. Equipment is all water glasses and a rake. Even though he says he is wearing a wet suit, the equipment is very simple. This is all the respirators that have air hoses connected to them. It is said that the sturdy helmet used by deep sea divers is better because it does not interfere with the extraction of the key shell.

   When a mercury jumps into the sea, air bubbles rise up one by one over a calm surface. In the open sea, this is all about the traces of Mughly. All the sailors in the boat can do is wait for his signal, then lower the fishing net, and check whether the air is getting well through the air hose or if the hose is not twisted.

   Until the end of the work, the head must struggle for two or three hours, walking alone in the cold and dark waters. Actually, the working time is not really decided for Mughly. When the specified amount is filled, the work is finished. If you go to the wrong place, you have to struggle with pain. The height of the shellfish that can be collected per day is limited to 3,000 US dollars. To protect fish resources. So, in order to get a good price, you need to dig a 25 ~ 28cm tall clam that grew 8 ~ 9 years. From April to May when clear water comes in, the view in the sea is bright, making it a good season to work. At this time, it is the wish of the murky to increase the income by working a lot.

   The key clam was named because the shape of the clam was similar to the key that smashed the sword of grain. It was collected from the South Sea, such as Jangheung, Jeollanam-do, and exported to Japan, but in the 1970s, it became known as a major production area for the key seashells as it became known that a lot of shellfishes lived near the Ocheon Port in the West Sea.

   In the past, all shellfish was exported to Japan, so it was hard to taste. In the 1990s, it appeared in the market and sold in restaurants, making it an easy food to eat. Even now, about 30% of production is exported to Japan.

   Key shellfish is a low-calorie food and contains a lot of minerals and vitamins that benefit the body. Paeju is a treasure trove of zinc containing 12.8 mg per 100 g of zinc. Protein also contained 18.2 g per 100 g and taurine 994 mg per 100 g. It is good for postpartum cooking or fatigue recovery of pregnant women because it has a blood clotting effect, and is also effective in protecting the liver that has been abused by alcohol.

   Galmaemot Holy Land, which holds the sad history of Catholic persecution
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   In the vicinity of Ocheon Port is the Galmaemot Holy Land, which holds the sad history of Catholic persecution. This is the place where five people, including Bishop Davllu, Father Ometre, and Father Wien, were arrested during the persecution on March 30, 1866. At this time, the remains of three martyred priests are placed in the basement of the Myeongdong Cathedral.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   There is a reason that this distant beach became the scene of Catholic persecution. In June of the 12th year of the Joseon Dynasty (1846), three French warships anchored at the remotest island of Boryeong. Then, in the persecution of Gihae (1839), he left a letter in the box asking for responsibility for the murder of three French missionaries, including Enver, Imitation, and Father Charles. The case was regarded as an invasion of the territorial waters of Joseon by the court. At that time, the execution of Father Kim Dae-geon, who was in prison, was accelerated, and on March 30, 1866, in the sense that Heungseon-daewon troops threw a Western orangka, five French swimmers, including Bishop Davllu, took a swimming near the island of the French invasion. The bride was dragged and executed. The position of the martyrdom is now standing where the priests were executed.
