    A stream flowing from the foothills east of Seoraksan Daecheongbong to the East Sea, Dunjeon Valley. The valley is named Dungeon, but its waterways flow with Dungeon-ri, Gangok-ri, and Seokgyo-ri. The valley becomes narrower and the untouched nature greets travelers as it goes up against the clear and cool stream.

    Seokgyo-ri, Ganghyeon-myeon, Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do Depart from Seokgyo-gyo, walk through Gangok-ri, and walk about 3.2 km of country road to the valley below Dungeon Reservoir in Dunjeon-ri. This is a road that goes back 3.2km from Seokgyo-ri, Gangok-ri, and Dunjeon-ri among the 8-km water that flows from the foothills of Seoraksan Daecheongbong to the East Sea after gathering at the Dungeon Reservoir.

   Seokgyo-ri, which I can play with

  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Seokgyo-ri In the vicinity of Seokgyo-gyo Bridge, I am wide and the flow of the stream is not fast enough to play. It's nice to see my father playing with a child on a rubber boat. Young men and women play with splashes of water in the palms of their hands. The laughter of the naughty children playing in the water at the dog swims in the stream. In the hands of the mother who calls the children sitting on the treeside stream, there is half the corn left behind.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Some people enjoy swimming in the shade under the stone bridge. When I soak my feet in the stream, it is cooler than being in the sun. There is a restaurant on the stream, creating an amusement park atmosphere. After playing in the water, I ate a bowl of Makguksu from the nearby Yeonggwangjeong Buckwheat Noodles and headed for Gangokri.
    <br/>
    There is a narrow paved road next to Yeonggwangjeong Buckwheat Noodles. If you go that way, it's Gangokri. In the distance, the foot of Mt. When you walk a little, you will come to Samgeori. If you go downhill on the right, you will meet the valley of Gangok-ri.

    The downtown of Seokgyo-ri has a wide and well-maintained amusement park atmosphere, while the Gangok-ri valley is narrower. You can see a stroller under the big tree shade. On the mat next to it, the mother and baby take a nap. Big children and dads soak in the water and play in the water.
    <br/>
    Cross the Gangok Bridge and turn left and walk along the road. The road is far from the valley, but the valley can be seen through the forest.
   </p>

  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    The forest on the rocky cliffs shaded the valley. The blue water stream seduces the sweaty traveler. 속 Even if you hear the sound of flowing water, you feel cool. The scenery that cannot be visited due to the lack of roads remains a unexplored view. Occasionally, there is a road going down the valley, but when it meets such a path, it goes down to the shore and washes the sweat to cool the heat. The more upstream, the deeper the forest and the clearer the water. I am happy when I am sitting inside. It's like resting here.
    <br/>
    Climb up the road again and walk upstream. A yellow sunflower reached out under the red tin roof. It's like a rural village where I played as a child.

    There is a three-story stone pagoda in Jinjeonsa Temple next to the road. Jinjeonsaji Temple was the site of Jinjeonsa Temple, which was founded in the Unified Silla period around the 8th century. It was the place where the Master Doui, who caused the Zen of Korea, retired, and also the place where the high priests such as Yeomgeo burn and auxiliary missionaries were produced. It is said that Ilyeon, a monk who built “The Three Kingdoms”, which we are familiar with, was a monk here.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    The three-story stone pagoda, designated as National Treasure No. 122, remains at the temple, indicating that it was a measure of enlightenment. Take a break in front of the tower and think about the way you have been walking so far. About 1km from Seokgyo Bridge to Gangok Bridge, about 1.7km from Gangok Bridge to Jinjeonsa Temple, and about 500m to the valley below Dungeon Reservoir to go. People often come to Seokgyo-ri or Gangok-ri, but there are not many people in Dungeon-ri valley. The place with the fewest people's footsteps would have been a valley of magnificent rock formations in the old Cheopgwipsan Mountain.

    I can hear the sound of water that is incomparable to what I heard in Seokgyo-ri and Ganggok-ri. The valley becomes more valley-friendly in Dunjeon-ri. It is a green forest and blue water flows under the cliff. The water flowing through the large creek on the rock breaks white. The water flowing between the rocks and falling rocks creates a large and small waterfall. The puddle below it is so black that it cannot measure its depth. The young men wear life jackets and jump into the puddle.
    <br/>
    Standing on a huge rock, overlooking the valley. It is felt with the five senses that primitive nature opens in forests and valleys with less man's hands.
