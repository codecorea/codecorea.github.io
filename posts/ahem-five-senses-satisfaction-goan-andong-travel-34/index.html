   Andong, Gyeongsangbuk-do, is considered one of the first hands in the 'Korean Yangbango'. Known as 'the town of Hahoe Village', Andong is not only a traditional Yangban culture but also a popular folk culture such as Hahoe Mask Dance.

   Andong, Gyeongbuk. The vague feeling of 'far' may be due to the influence of space-time rather than the actual distance. This is because spaces such as Seowon and Hyanggyo stop at the time, including Hahoe Village in the Nakdong River. Thanks to the traces of our ancestors who enjoyed academics and styles, emphasizing righteousness and courtesy, we thought of Seonbi and Yangban in Andong.

   Some ways to travel Yangban
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Andong is said to have originated in Changnyeongguk, founded by Yeomsang Dosa in 57 BC. It is called Gotaya-gun and Gochang-gun in Silla era. Afterwards, he entered the Joseon Dynasty and was promoted to Andong-do. Daedohobu is the name of a local administrative agency that was placed in the main town of the Joseon Dynasty. In addition to Andong, it was installed in Gangneung, Pyeongan, Yeongbyeon, and Hamgyeong, Yeongheung. In 1896 (Gojong 33), Andong-gun was passed to Andong-eup in 1931. In 1995, the Andong-gun was merged into Andong-si. This is the reason why it has the largest area among the nation's counties.

   Therefore, Andong travel should be considered in consideration of the line. It can be divided into Hahoe Village, which binds Hahoe Village, Byeongsan Seowon, and Gyeongbuk Provincial Offices, Dosan Seowon, which binds Dosan Seowon, Toegye Jongtaek, and Andong City Area, which combines Andong Cultural Tourism Complex, Old Market, and New Market. This trip is a course that combines the Andong-gu market and the new market with a view of Gyeongbuk Provincial Government, Hahoe Village and Dosan Seowon. Of course, one night and two days can be enjoyed in order to taste Andong's special mackerel and hut jesak rice and enjoy Andong Lake's night view.

   Andong Travel NO.1 Poongsan Ryu's Zipseong Village Hahoe Village
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   It is 5.7km from Gyeongsangbuk-do, Gyeonggi-do and Hahoe Village in 10 minutes by car. Hahoe Village, a 600-year-old village of Pungsan Ryu, flows in the 'S' shape with the Nakdong River surrounding the village. This is why the village name became 'Hahoe'. In feng shui geography, it is 'soft softening type' which is considered as the best road. It resembles a lotus floating on water. It is famous for being a good place for people to live in since Joseon Dynasty because there are mountains and rivers centering on villages. In July 2010, it was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

   Because of the town's shape, which is softened, it is heavy when a stone wall is piled up. It is good to take a map and look around every corner, but walking slowly and comfortably along the dirt road is a good way to travel to Hahoe Village. To get around Hahoe village properly, it takes from 2 hours to half a day. If time is running out, take the treasure Yangjin-dang (Treasure No. 306) and Chung Hyo-Dang (Treasure No. 414) that Hahoe Village holds. Yang Jin-dang was the home of Ryu Joong-young and his eldest son Ryu Un-yong, while Chung Hyo-dang was Jong-taek of Ryu Sung-ryong.

The beautiful Seowon, which overlooks the flowing stems of the Nakdong River, began in 1575 when Seo-ae Ryu Sung-ryong moved Pungak Seodang in Pungsan-eup. Ryu Sung-ryong's pupils and larvae set up his shrine here and became a formal vow. It is one of 47 vows and shrines that received the sum of 'Byeongsan' in 1863 and survived the Seowon Abolition of Heungseondaewon.

   Andong Braised Chicken is a good size to eat, and the bone-cut chicken is cooked in advance. A large amount is not enough even if three or four people eat. The price is 25,000 won per head. Thanks to the generous amount and low price, it attracts a lot of light college students and beginners. You can adjust the spicyness when ordering. After the steamed chicken, the market size is a bonus. Don't miss the new market, which is a 5-minute walk from the old market. You can see Andong Gourmet Mackerel as well as see how it is made.
