    Ethiopia Korea Exhibition of War Memorial, which opened in 2007 at the entrance of Ethiopia Road. This building is a traditional Ethiopian house with three domed roofs. Ethiopia is one of the 16 countries to which the United Nations troops have been sent in the Korean War. Ethiopia's participation in the Korean War has a special story. Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935. Ethiopia has been asked for help from around the world, but has been neglected. Emperor Haile Selassie I, Ethiopia, who suffered from this pain, decided to send troops when the Korean War broke out.

    The first floor, consisting of the War Memorial and Multi-purpose Room, records the Ethiopian Army's dispatch of Korean war and majors. Start watching the video about 10 minutes in the multipurpose room. The Ethiopian Army's military uniforms, rifles, and medals attract attention. On the wall, there were 253 battles recorded by 6037 Ethiopian troops from May 1951 to March 1965. There is also a description of the emperor's name, “Kagnew”. Ethiopia, which means ‘to inflict a decisive blow on one's opponents or to destroy them.’ In front of a picture of an Ethiopian soldier attached to a military record book and the name of a warrior inscribed on a copper plate, he becomes a performer.

The Pungmul Exhibition Hall was decorated mainly in the coffee culture of Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee. Ethiopian traditional coffee utensils such as tables, cups and scales arouse curiosity.

    Time dates back to 1968. In May of that year, the Ethiopian War was erected in Gongjicheon in honor of the participation and sacrifice of the Ethiopian army. Emperor Haile Selassie, the Ethiopian Emperor, decided to send troops. He suggested to the Korean government to build an Ethiopian memorial mission. Cho Yong-yi and Kim Ok-hee, who heard this, confessed to the end of the year to build an Ethiopian house. Haile Selassie I gave the name 'Ethiopiabet' and the golden lion symbol of the imperial family. Imperial green beans were also sent until 1974, before Ethiopia became communist. Based on the relationship, the Ethiopian house has become a cafe serving Ethiopian coffee beans.

    The 1970s and 1980s were the days when coffee shops represented coffee. So, Ethiopia House was a unique destination for those visiting Chuncheon. Some people ordered coffee from newspapers in a cafe when the table was full. There were many couples who got married here after facing the opposition.

    When I entered the first floor of the Ethiopian house, the spring sunshine passed through the window toward Gongjicheon. At sunset, the shadows are long and quiet. The theme of Ethiopia remains. There are many things that show Ethiopia's ties to Haile Selassie's 1st photo, traditional books, and coffee products. It also boasts a classic sensibility unique to the old space. If you drink a cup of coffee while looking at Gongjicheon, it seems that you have entered an old foreign cafe, not even Ethiopia.

    It is not far from the Ethiopian Korean War Exhibition. It is an old saying that duck boats come to mind when you think of Chuncheon. The water trail is a course where you can travel by water on a wooden canoe. The canoe departs from Songam Sports Town and travels around Uiam Lake. Easy to learn. After learning how to hold a paddle in the field and rowing, go straight to the canoe. In recent years, the king canoe is as popular as the two-seater canoe. The 12-seater King Canoe takes the direction of the Kingsman. You can cultivate a stronger bond and cooperation between family and friends. It can be used by 4 or more people.

    If you want to get out of the waterway, head to the old Kim Yu-jeong Station. This word-of-mouth communication on the SNS is romantic for the sensational murals and frame photo zones of the station buildings. In particular, interesting signs are added to the platform stop sign to attract attention. This is a must-have course for lovers to take pictures of. The old Gyeongchun Line Mugunghwaho train on the railroad is converted to a book cafe, so it's good to pass a bookshelf or spend a quiet time looking out the window. Let's take a walk along the Silay Yagi Road, which leads to Kim Yu-jeong Literature Village Memorial Hall, Romantic Nuri, and Book and Print Museum. You can take a look at Kim Yoo-jung's short stories, such as &lt;Camellia Flower&gt; and &lt;Spring / Spring&gt;, as if you were reading them as a landscape.

    Young lovers enjoy the Gubongsan Observatory Cafe Street. There are several interesting cafés with photo zones and Gubongsan Skywalk, which are full of Santorini atmosphere. The sunset over Chuncheon downtown is beautiful. Recently, the 'floating street' is the land forest in Chuncheon. The declining streets have changed since three years ago when young merchants moved in. Local open-air shops, Neutro-style cafés, and restaurants blend naturally. When a light bulb lights up on the street, it is as lively as an exotic night market.

    The animation museum is perfect for family trips. It was refurbished last fall and opened again. The enjoyment of watching video content increased by securing the copyrights of Pororo, Dooley, and Hani. Children's favorite cartoon movie dubbing experience program was reinforced and two additional dubbing rooms were installed. Taekwon V, a large 6m high, is also a new family. The building next to the Animation Museum is a toy robot museum operated by experience center. If you purchase an integrated admission ticket, you can look around at a cheaper price.
