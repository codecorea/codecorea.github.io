   Basketball stadiums are visited by visitors from a variety of floors than other sports. Tickets to the stadium are cheap and the rules of the game are easy to understand. The professional basketball season is held at the end of the year and at the beginning of the year when the winter turns. The 2015-2016 KBL-D (Korean Basketball League-Development, or D-League) kicked off with the first match at the Goyang Indoor Gymnasium. Anyang KGC Ginseng Corp. and Goyang Orion Orions are the teams in Gyeonggi-do. The indoor gymnasium in each area is used as a home stadium, so you can feel the enthusiastic cheering.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Tickets are divided into seats and seats, and seats vary in price depending on the number of floors and locations. Wherever you sit, the stadium is at a glance, and the large screen is set up so you can see the game. But if you want to be more enthusiastic, I recommend the seats in front of the cheerleader. The eyes of the cheerleaders keep coming into contact with each other, so you can have a great time. When you enter the stadium after ticketing, you will be given cheering tools. Two hours will pass quickly and the alarm clock will ring in your stomach. Now it's time to enjoy the game with people and delicious food.

   The broth used for food is Sanyacho broth containing camphor. The precious Sanyacho of Jecheon, located around Sobaeksan, Woraksan, and Chiaksan, and the camphor ginseng grown around Heungjeong Valley flowing below Pyeongchang Heungjeong Mountain are the main ingredients of the main broth. If you add mussel juice to this basic broth, you can make Samgyetang broth. If you add seasonings seasoned with various ingredients, you can make Haesintang broth.

   Sanyacho and camphor broth containing broth is common, but the secret here is to use salt and soy sauce at all. When you eat hot soup, the soup is drowsy and the salty taste is stronger. Then, you can pour more broth, but the soup in this house is not salty at all. Thanks to the harmony of the golden ratio of wild vegetables and seafood found hundreds of times. It looks like an old restaurant, but it's now in its fifth year. The background is the love of Sanyacho over 20 years.

   Another restaurant in front of Anyang Indoor Gymnasium is the Chinese restaurant, Janggang. The owner, who has been running the shop for over 20 years, boasts 50 years of Chinese cuisine. One of the most popular dishes in this house is cold champon. It's hard to imagine how champon can be chilled with oil and broth. The cold broth seems to be floating, but the cold champon is very clean and refreshing. Spicy broth filled with seafood is the secret. The seafood in the cold broth is tangle, and the seafood tastes better than the hot broth.

   Goyang Indoor Gymnasium, Hidden Neighborhood Restaurants

  <div class="txt_p">
   It's sports spirit that doesn't dwell on the game, but it's hard not to be upset if the team that cheers hard. Sweet food then is the best comfort. On the way to Goyang Indoor Gymnasium, there is a sweet and spicy 'Ilsan Tangsuyuk'. Three years ago, the owner, who was contemplating the restaurant menu, chose sweet and sour pork as his main item. I didn't know much about Chinese food, but because of the belief that sweet and sour pork would be popular and could be transformed into a new taste. The people first tasted sweet and sour pork. Since then, rumors began to appear on the Internet, and people from all over the country came. There were also chain stores in Goyang, near Madu Station, Bucheon, and Uiwang.

   Sweet and sour pork in this house is sweet and sour pork fried with glutinous rice flour. Crispy and chewy than fried with flour. The sauce is usually two flavors and spicy. Sweet and aftertaste slightly sour but not too sweet or too sweet. Another secret to sweet and sour taste is to season the meat in advance and not add soy sauce to the sauce. This winter, the fish cake soup appeared as a new menu in the shop, which only stuck to sweet and sour pork. It is a menu prepared for the constant demands of regular customers who enjoy sweet and sour liquor along with sweet and sour pork. It also sells a variety of Chinese liquors. After ordering, sweet and sour pork is fried, so it takes about 15 minutes for food to come out. It sells wraps, but does not wrap leftovers. Sweet and sour pork with sauce loses its original taste over time.

   The secret to earning the reputation as 'the best fire chicken restaurant in Ilsan' is in sauce. Only the master knows the secret sauce. The use of smoked chicken there is a well known trick. Grill the grilled chicken in the kitchen next to the entrance. Selected smoked chicken is grilled crispy on charcoal, put on fire, and sauced over the grill. The spiciness can be selected to a degree, which is divided into spicy, less spicy, and moderately spicy. It's okay to have an obscure order that says, "Please make it hot enough to eat properly." If you want to check the reputation of this house's Bulgogi, spicy is recommended. A set menu where you can eat egg soup, fish cake soup, udon noodles and other spicy rice balls. Packing and delivery are also available.
