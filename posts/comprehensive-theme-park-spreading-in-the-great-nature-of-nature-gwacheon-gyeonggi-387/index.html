   When you enter the Seoul Grand Park, you are excited about the spacious nature and relaxed gestures of the animals. The site area is about 9,157 km² (about 2.77 million pyeong), making it difficult to measure the scale at once. If you are away from the complex city center and blend natural greenery, you can spend a lot of time with children, from animals and plants to camping in the woods and visiting the Museum of Modern Art.

    If you visited this place with an infant or toddler, we recommend the Pony House where horses live and the 'Secret Way Tour', a horse ecological exploration program.
   </strong>
   Tours include curiosity of race horses, which are usually restricted, which adds curiosity. Gather at Geumdongcheonma, take the Secretway tour bus, and first arrive at the horse pool. This is where swimming training is done to become a strong and fast horse. Swimming for young horses promotes development and increases muscle flexibility, and for horses, the development of cardiopulmonary function increases endurance. In Maple, you can actually hear the harsh breath of the horse ringing the pool.

Here you can also experience comparing horseshoe for racing and horseback riding. The racing horse is silver and the horse riding horse is black, so the horseshoe of the racing horse is much lighter. Horses are so large and organs are complex animals, so they cannot go to any hospital, so they go to a horse hospital. Occasionally, you can watch the actual surgical procedure at a horse hospital. Children who chattered like sparrows are also breathtaking here, looking at the treatment of horses.
