   Many young people visit the Central Market because they are connected to the street of Jung-dong Culture called Myeong-dong. The free market next to the central market is a modern mall. If you go down to the first floor, there are small restaurants that sell Korean representative snacks, Tteokbokki, Tempura, and Sundae. There are restaurants in the form of seats, but there are signboards such as Friendship House, Tonere, and Friendly Tteokbokki.

   Does it mean that it is hard to find in the corner of the basement? Or does it mean that it's hard to find a restaurant like this? 'Hard home to find it' (033-745-0031) is a place where you can taste special cutlet. If you eat it with spicy rice balls or spicy rice balls or tteokbokki, it's a great meal. Pork cuts are ground twice a day and fried at the same time as the order. Kim Don is made of rice balls topped with neat pork cutlet and spicy kimchi toppings. You can have several different menus. Kodonburo is also a popular dish, with fried cheese and vegetables. The low price of less than 6,000 won is also attractive, but the interior of the café on the second floor of the attic is a great way to attract young people.

   Hanwoo Alley, which has been alive since late afternoon, is a spot in the Jungwon Traditional Market that everyone knows.

At first glance, it has a shabby appearance and few tables, but you need to make a reservation to settle down in the evening. It is popular because you can taste special parts such as Korean beef meat, insole meat at reasonable prices. It is a friendly alley where you can face a forehead on a small brazier and share a drink at a piece of meat.
