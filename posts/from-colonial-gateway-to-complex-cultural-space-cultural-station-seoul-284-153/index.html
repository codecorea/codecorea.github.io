    Modeled after the Swiss Lucerne station, this magnificent brick building was once a colonial gateway. Japan tried to connect not only Manchuria but also Moscow and Berlin. The defeat made the Japanese ambition disappeared, but Seoul Station was still the center of transportation on the Korean Peninsula.

   Are there any Koreans who don't know Seoul Station? If you're an adult, you'll probably remember one of the memories of taking a train at the old Seoul Station in a red brick building. Now, the functions related to trains have been yielded to a new history and established as a complex cultural space, but the old Seoul Station, opened in 1925, has been the gateway to Seoul for nearly 80 years and is the representative railway station of Korea.

   The designer of the old Seoul history, where the western arches with a magnificent dome are exotic, is known as Yasushi Sukamoto, a student of Tatsuno Kingo who designed Tokyo Station. At the time of construction, Seoul Station was an extra-large building with a total area of 6,631㎡ and was established as the "East 2nd Station," succeeding the "East 1st Station," Tokyo Station. After that, many parts were destroyed during the Korean War, but until the construction of the new Seoul Station in 2003, the old Seoul Station was the starting point and arrival point for numerous trains. Now, it is a complex cultural space called “Culture Station Seoul 284”, but it still remains as a memory of travel for many.

    However, Seoul Station was not simply built as a representative train station of Gyeongseong, the colony. In Japan, Seoul Station was planned as an 'international station' connecting Japan, Chosun and Manchuria. After the Japanese National Railways from Tokyo reached Shimonoseki, they changed to the Busan Line by connecting the deputy liaison line, and then boarded the train again to connect Seoul Station to Manchuria, Siberia, and even Moscow and Berlin. Accordingly, the entity that built Seoul Station was Nammanju Railway Co., Ltd. Called the abbreviation of “Mancheol,” the company was an imperialism for colonial management, just like the British East India Company. Like the UK, which railroaded across India to colonize colonies, Japan also adopted railroads as its central business for colonial management in Manchuria.

   In front of the RTO performance hall, there is a statue of a person wearing a hanbok scroll that does not match the high-tech complex cultural facilities. The left hand holds a fist with the size of a head, and the right hand has a grenade-shaped explosive. On September 2, 1919, during the Japanese colonial rule, he was an independent activist who threw a bomb at Seoul Station to kill the newly appointed Japanese governor, Saiko Makoto, in the wake of the 3.1 movement. It was still before the history of Seoul was built. Unfortunately, the bomb was missed, and doctor Kang Woo-gyu, who was caught during the escape, was executed at the Seodaemun Prison the following year. It should not be forgotten that the blood of independent activists is flowing in the background of the rebirth of Seoul Station 284 in Korea, which was built during the Japanese occupation.
