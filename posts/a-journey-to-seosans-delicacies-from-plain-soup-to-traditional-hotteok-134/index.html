   The warm spring breeze blows softly and the hips are hilarious. The energy of spring multiplies the excitement of travel. It's a good season to go anywhere. The sea full of spring breeze is good and the market full of spring energy is good. If you add seasonal delicacies that will enhance your taste buds in spring, you can add icing. It would be better if the food is not common anywhere. So I chose Seosan, Chungnam, where the sea, the market, and seasonal delicacies are located.

   What is soup?
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   If you are looking for Seosan on the west coast, many will taste Jukkumi Shabu Shabu or Urukhoe. If you add one, it's a local delicacy. The food is familiar to the Seosan people, but the name is strange to the outsiders. You can think of it as Maeuntang because it is a soup that is made with Urug. I might be worried that it will be rude. But the soup is a light dish with immaculate soup. It is closer to North Korea or Hwang than Thailand.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The main ingredient of the soup is Urugpo. Urug, also called zodiac rock, usually gives birth in spring. Because you gain weight before spawning, you can enjoy the spring season. There are many occasions where you can enjoy spring Uruk, which is full of flesh. Remove the guts and split in half and season with salt. Then, in the spring sunshine and wind, they usually dry for three days to complete Urugpo.
   <br/>
   Now that the main character, Urugpo, is finished, let's boil the soup. You'll need a supporting shrimp sashimi, and prepare radish, green onions, and chopped garlic, which are usually served in a clear soup. Add tofu, which will add a lot of richness, and even dry peppers to give it a bitter flavor. Boil soup with rice water rather than plain water to make it taste stronger.

   In Urukukguk, it is 'one of the gods' that uses dried Urukpo instead of raw Urukpo. In the Seosan area, Urugpo was posted on a Buddhist memorial service, and it was said that the origin of Urugukguk was that the soup was eaten after it was finished. The dried fish makes the texture soft and chewy and doesn't have a fishy taste. The soup is so light that everyone can enjoy it. If you put the fluffy meat in your mouth, the flavor will spread. Once you drink a thick broth and bite a chubby meat, a bowl of rice disappears in no time.

   Grandmother Hotteok. If you enter the market place from the parking lot of the market, you will see the trade name 'Old Bakery'. You can feel the 'force' from the hotteok plate like the green drum. These days, it's hard to see these hot cakes. The oil is lightly brewed with a very light coat. The secret to the taste is the dough made with makgeolli and acorn jelly instead of chemical additives. The chewy and delicious taste is attractive. It is also fun to see the skillful work of grandmothers who have worked for decades.

If you enter the alley where Sundae Gukbap and Kalguksu are gathered to the side of the direct market place, you will see 'Market aid Ho Tteok'. This is also a decades old hotteok house. Seosan is a shop where locals chew on their memories. The cast iron pan and the pot lid are impressive. Bake it in a pan, cover it with a pot, and steam it slightly until it is cooked. It uses less oil and makes the rice cake taste lighter. In both houses, two hot cakes cost 1,000 won. It is a good price. After eating a bowl of soup, enjoy a hot cake of Seosan Dongbu Market as a dessert.
