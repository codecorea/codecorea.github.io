   If you want to find the taste that you lost in April when spring energy is full, crispy and refreshing ssambap is the best. There is no such thing as a fresh ssam vegetable with a taste that has only been picked up. After eating plenty of protein and vitamin ssambap and sleeping sweetly, the heavy body wakes up.

   If you go to Anyang, Namyangju, and Ilsan in the suburbs of Seoul, there are many fresh and delicious ssambap restaurants. On a sunny spring day, I visited three ssambap restaurants in Ilseoksamjo where you can climb, watch flowers and eat delicious ssambap.

   Namyangju ‘Mokhyangwon’ with fresh air and delicious ssam rice

  <div class="txt_p">
   Even after about an hour away from Seoul, the air is different and the vision is different. When you enter Namyangju, Gyeonggi-do, you will find Mokhyangwon at the end of the road beyond Deokneung Pass and into Heungkuksa Temple. I wonder if there will be a ssambap restaurant in this remote place. The three rustic thatched houses, the janggok in the pot, the small pond decorated with wood, and the splendid sperm seem to come to the country house.

   Three thatched houses accommodating up to 200 people are always full at lunchtime, so you must get a waiting ticket at the entrance. Walking slowly through the cozy park, the average waiting time is 30 minutes. There are many visitors climbing and descending the mountains of Suseong and Buam, and it is even more crowded from March to October.

   When you enter the restaurant, the fragrant charcoal bulgogi stimulates your appetite. In the back of the restaurant, there is a staff who grills only bulgogi on charcoal all day. The grill on pork charcoal fired on top of a good charcoal fire is rotated 23 times, and it is grilled sharply. The carefully grilled pork bulgogi is placed on a hot plate and served on a guest table. The pork bulgogi is good because it's hot.

   The ssam vegetables that are farmed and delivered directly from the Yangpyeong Dumulmeori organic complex are reliable because the worm-eaten holes are sore. Infinite refills of seven ssam vegetables, including Dacheongchae, Cheongromain, red mustard, kale, red beetroot, lettuce, and red rose main. The kimchi that is made every day is fresh, and the miso stew stewed with the soybean paste soaked in the mouth contains the savory taste of a rural grandmother. The softly fried Siraegi is more delicious because it's from Andong, and the ssamjang with scoop is chewy and the dish is wrapped in a chewy taste. The most eye-catching thing on the table is the black rice, rice, and rice on the plate. Even though the quantity is quite large, I cannot give up either yellow rice with a good taste or black rice with soft taste or soft rice.

   Ssambap with seasonal side dishes, Anyang “Ssam Thief”
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   If a hiker climbs to Gwanak Mountain and descends to Anyang, there is a house to visit without forgetting. It is a famous ssam thief with ssam rice filled with wildflowers that the owner has grown as a hobby for 10 years. A large placard at the entrance of the restaurant stands out. Environmental burden 2,000 won. It is a fine that customers who pay a side dish must pay. When you step inside the restaurant, you know why. At one side of the restaurant, there are more than 10 kinds of ssam vegetables that change according to season, such as romaine lettuce, cabbage, kale, red pepper curry, green mustard, red mustard, dachungchae, red lettuce, celery, and Angelica. Next to it, there are cool white kimchi, green bean sprouts, deodeokjangchi, wooji jijim, mulberry sprouts, lotus root salad, burdock pickles, sheepskin and seed ssamjang. Eight kinds of side dishes are charming without missing any one, so if you greedyly eat them, you usually forget your meal. It is important not to forget the environmental burden while eating.

   Ssam Thief's popular menus include Onggi boiled pork, roasted mackerel and grilled mackerel. The savory stir-fried pork marinated with fresh fruit and steamed lotus leaf duck over leek are the best menu for ssambap. The spicy stir-fried pork or plain duck meat is placed on the ssam, and the nutty ssamjang with plenty of sunflower seeds, peanuts, and pumpkin seeds is a savory taste. Norwegian mackerel is delicious in the oven, moistly baked and placed on ssam, and soft to eat.

   Another virtue of Ssam Thief is that you can go and eat alone. Onggi boil, which comes with stir-fried pork, is only available, but it is good news for those who want to eat ssambap alone. The lunch and dinner prices are the same, so it's also economical for evening gatherings. After eating and going down to the first floor, you can drink coffee from a professional barista, so you don't have to go to a cafe in the distance. It is a rice restaurant of ssambap, coffee, wildflowers, and ilseok samjo.

   Ssambab, Goyang 'Leaf Bird'

  <div class="txt_p">
   Around Pungdong Pungsan Station, Ilsandong-gu, Goyang-si, it is famous for a food street called Anygol. If you go straight about 300m from the entrance of Anygol, you can see the ssambap, the leaf bird, on the right. When entering the restaurant, the interior is fresh, decorated like an exotic pasta house rather than a Korean restaurant.

   When you order ssambap, there is a wide variety of side dishes as well as ssam vegetables that come out generously. The leaves, which opened in 2001 in Ilsan, where there are exceptionally many ssambap restaurants, have long run as ssambap shops for 18 years, have many old classics. The interior is large enough to accommodate over 100 seats, but the atmosphere is long even on weekdays. From March to October, it is always crowded with guests from all over the country. Especially at Goyang International Flower Fair, it is more crowded with customers who come to see flowers. Avoiding mealtime is another way to reduce waiting time.

   If you order the ssambap set meal, fusion side dishes are rich in addition to salad, tofu kimchi, kimchi jeon, japchae, tangpyeongchae, jellyfish seasoning, and uncooled radish. Fresh barley rice is served in a neat bebo porcelain, and fresh ssam vegetables are full on the plate. Bean sprouts, ferns, spinach, shiitake mushrooms, and other herbs for bibimbap are also severely seasoned. If you put red pepper paste and perilla oil and rub it, wrap it in lettuce or Chinese cabbage. There are only 16 types of ssam, and they are changed to various ssam vegetables depending on the season.

   If you don't have the red pepper paste grilled on the charcoal, seasoned with red pepper paste, you can add it. The grilled pork belly with a little greasy taste goes well with ssambap. The miso soup stewed with potatoes and thickly boiled is perfect for ssambap. It's a cozy and comfortable atmosphere, so it's okay to settle for a cup of coffee on the spot after a meal, unless it's a complicated lunch break.
