    As we enter the stretched fir forest, the heat outside is quickly forgotten. The green energy infiltrates the whole body as it climbs on a soft dirt road in a dense forest. In accordance with the steps taken one by one, things that bothered the body and mind disappear one by one. Holding in the green wave, 'healing' becomes a clause only by deep breathing. This is Woljeongsa Firwood Forest, a millennium temple of Odaesan, Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do.

   What is a 'good way'? A space that tells us where we are breathing? Or is it a shelter that lets you forget about reality for a moment and rest? Perhaps we are interested in the paths of the world, because even at this moment, we are walking down the path that has opened in front of each other. Perhaps the reason why walking tours are popular is because of the expectation that you will be able to better walk on the roads that are divided into countless minds through training on walking in front of you.

    Thanks to this, there are many “walk-only paths” on this land. Starting with Jeju Olle and Jirisan Dulle-gil, each village has its own way. There are a variety of roads around us, from trekking trails to trekking trails to casual hiking shoes and sandals. Today's path is the Woljeongsa Fir Forest, located at the foot of Mt.

   Odaesan Mountain, where Woljeongsa Fir Forest is located, was designated as a national park in 1975. Millennium Considered Woljeongsa Temple and Senwonsa Temple, many people continue to walk. Today, after walking through the fir forest of Woljeongsa Temple, we will take a look at Woljeongsa Temple and Senwonsa Temple. If you're confident in trekking, it's also a good idea to walk the Odaesan Seonjae-gil, which spans 9km from Woljeongsa to Sangwonsa.

    Now, let's walk through the fir forest. Woljeongsa Fir Tree Forest is located on the side of the road about 1km from Iljumun to Geumgang Bridge. There are two reasons why this road, which is only 2km away and only a 30-minute walk away, has become one of the most famous celebrities. One is thanks to the firs around the road, which I introduced earlier, and the other is due to Woljeongsa Temple, which set the ground for this forest. In the name 'Woljeongsa Fir Forest Path', all the reasons are contained.

    To enter the Woljeongsa fir forest, you must head to Woljeongsa from Odaesan National Park in Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do. On the forest path from Woljeongsa Temple Iljumun to Geumganggyo Bridge, people who want to enjoy the forest bathing in all seasons come to visit. Own vehicle users often go to the parking lot of Woljeongsa Temple, which is located after one order. Crossing the Geumgang Bridge from the parking lot, you will reach Woljeongsa Fir Forest Road. From here, you can walk to Iljumun.

    The fir forest from Geumgang Bridge to Iljumun is not long as described above, but it is not boring to repeat it several times. The fir forest has another name, “A Millennium Forest Road,” thanks to the fact that there are more than 1,800 fir trees on average over 80 years old. If you listen attentively, you will hear a story told by thinly stretched fir trees. People who fall in love with the fir forest path can walk dozens of times each time they find it. In fact, if you are walking through Saab Saab Saab in a narrow dirt road and a stretched fir forest, the worries left behind in reality disappear. This is the way I want to walk forever. Unlike the thorny field road in reality, this path is soft and has a corner to comfort the tired modern people.

    Fir is a name given that milk (milk) comes out when a wound is injured. Refreshing scent comes out of the leaf. That's right, it's a good phytoncide for the human body. If you enjoyed enough forest bathing by taking in the scent of phytoncide, go to Woljeongsa Temple.

   To see Woljeongsa Temple, you must first look at the Jajangyulsa Temple (590 ~ 658). He was a member of the best family of Silla and was called as a re-prime before leaving for the family. He received a set of housework and a Buddhist temple from Munsu Bodhisattva when he was studying in Tang. After returning home, he took the site of Odaesan and enshrined the Buddha's bones. The small temple he built at the time is now Woljeongsa. Woljeongsa Temple, which occupied the place from the Silla period to the Goryeo-Chosun period, mostly disappeared in the Korean War. Only the octagonal-storied stone pagoda (National Treasure No. 48) and the stone statue of Bodhisattva (Treasure No. 139) made of incombustible stone remember over a thousand years. If you're looking for the Seongbo Museum, which houses the Changwon Seonmun of the Sangwonsa Temple and the Sari-gu of the Palgakgu Stone Pagoda, follow the stream to the Senwonsa Temple. It is 8km from Woljeongsa Temple to Sangwonsa Temple, and it is possible to walk along the Seonjae Road, which was introduced above, or by car.

    Along the ‘road of anguish,’ he reaches the Senate. Sangwonsa Temple is famous for the oldest and most beautiful Dongjong in Korea (National Treasure No. 36) and the deep wooden door manual for the Joseon Dynasty (National Treasure No. 221). First, let's look at the same kind that was created during the King Seongdeok of Silla. The utopia of the time can be seen through the homogeneous surface that vividly expresses the flowing clouds and fluttering zenith. Next up is the wooden door manual seat, which is considered the point of the Senate temple. His birth is related to King Sejo. Sejo, who took the throne by removing his nephew (discontinued), later suffered from a swelling of the whole body. In order to cure this, I was looking for good water from all over the country, and I came to the foot of Odaesan here. At this time, I met Munsu Bodhisattva who turned into a Buddhist monk. At this time, the Munsu-dong statue was created based on what Sejo saw.

    This is not all. A pair of cat statues can be seen under the stairs of Munsujeon. This too has a close relationship with King Sejo. When Sejo, who visited Senate, tries to enter the courthouse, a cat bites Sejo's hem and stops it. Sejo, who saved his life thanks to a cat who showed that his assassin was hiding, set aside rice fields and fields on this unusual cat. A cat statue was also built. If you've found a Senate, at least look closely.

    The path from the fir forest to Woljeongsa Temple and the Senate Temple is not burdensome. If you haven't walked the Seonjae-gil connecting Woljeongsa ~ Sangwonsa. After enjoying the phytoncide forest bathing in the fir forest, you can taste the energy of Odaesan without difficulty by looking at the Woljeongsa Temple and the Sangwonsa Temple, a millennium consideration. Now, with the energy from the fir forest, you can walk one more step and another step on the road to reality.
