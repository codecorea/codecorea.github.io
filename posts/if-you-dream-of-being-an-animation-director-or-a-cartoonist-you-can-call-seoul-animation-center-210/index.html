   Every time one's dream is blurred, everyone remembers his childhood when he thought he wanted to become an animation director or cartoonist.

   Stop motion animation made by myself

  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    The first thing to go to the Seoul Animation Center is a stop motion animation production experience. Let's start with the meaning of stop motion. After moving the object one inch at a time and repeating the process of shooting again, the video shows the moving effect of the object. If you make a character with clay (clay) and shoot it, it becomes 'Clay Animation', if you make a doll with various materials such as silicone or urethane, and you shoot it, it becomes 'Puppet Animation', and if you use any object as a character, it becomes 'Obje Animation'. Others include sand (sand) animations, which are sometimes seen on CF, and paper animations where a joint is drawn after drawing on paper.

The most recently created exhibition room, which is loved by visitors, is the Snowball World with Kioka. Trapezoidal paths for board games are made on the floor, and cute pictures of Kioka and friends live on the wall. If you look up at the ceiling with your head up, it seems that the big snowy eyes are going to pour down quickly.

   If you go out of the stop motion animation production experience and go to the building on the right, it is a manga museum with a signboard of 'Manga House'. It is a must-visit spot for manga enthusiasts. The first floor consisted of a library information room and the second floor consisted of an animatronic zone. If you leave with your ID card, you can fall into the reading scene without any interference from 9 am to 6 pm (but Mondays and legal holidays are closed).

It can be read only in the library information room, and external loans are not permitted. If you look at the viewers passing through the bookshelves while breathtakingly standing in various places in a comfortable position, I'd like to say, 'There is a calm place in the middle of Seoul'.

   Anytoon Zone has over 7,000 video materials, including domestic and foreign cartoons and animation-related videos and DVDs. You can borrow materials and watch them in one-person or two-person screenings. In particular, two-person screenings are great for lovers to sit side by side and appreciate the work. A group of 10 or more people (about 30-40 people) will be provided with a mini theater. Also, on the weekends, the animation works are shown 2-3 times a day in a regular screening format.
