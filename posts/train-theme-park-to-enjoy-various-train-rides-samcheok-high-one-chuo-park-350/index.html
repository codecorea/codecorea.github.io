   Swiss Mountain Train Encline Train and Rail Coaster
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   In 1939, the railroad was built to overcome the altitude difference between Sampok-si's Simpo-ri and Taebaek-si's Tongli and operate the train. It was a way to raise the train with wire rope. A wire rope was installed on the sloping railroad at 15.6 degrees and the train was raised. People had to walk on foot to reduce the weight of the train. When people came and went frequently, there was also a bearer who took the elderly on the road and climbed the road.

   There are 12 tunnels in this section, and you can see the light and sculptures created with different themes for each tunnel. Among them, the image of the tunnel composed of large watch weights and clock sound remains strong. In the tunnel, it seems to move to the time of the tunnel, not the time of the world, to lead the traveler to a new imaginary world. There are tunnels that increase tension with the sound of lightning and light, or where trees are shaped with optical fibers, etc., you can feel the atmosphere of a fantasy forest. You will enjoy the 7.7km section to the arrival point for about 25 minutes.

   In Korea, there was a switchback railroad between Heungjeon Station and Doohan Station in Gangwon-do. In 2012, a tunnel to replace the switchback section was opened, and no trains were allowed in this section. Chuchu Park operates a switchback train in that section. The switchback train is composed of a presidential carriage, a stove carriage, and so on, providing a different atmosphere for each carriage. The round trip from Chuchu Station to Nahanjeong Station takes about 80 minutes.

   At the beginning of a mountain road to Miin Falls, you pull a car and fold into the mountain road. If you go down a steep mountain path, you have to go through a small temple to reach the beauty waterfall. A passing box was placed at the passage of the temple, and the phrase “Insert 1,000 won” was written to manage facilities. No one keeps it, but thinks it as a cost to manage the surroundings, and puts 1,000 won into a beautiful waterfall. It's hard to go up and down the steep downhill to the beauty waterfall, but it's worth the effort by seeing the beauty of the beauty waterfall and the symposium.
