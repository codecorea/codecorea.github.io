    Gurichang Alley, Guri Market in Sutaek-dong, Guri, is also known as 'Doldari-gil Giblet Alley'. When you pass the market and go down the back of the stone bridge, you can smell the savory from the beginning. The giblet alley of 10 giblets gathered in the onggi boil has a continuous sizzling "sizzling" giblet.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   It was in the early 2000s that giblet houses entered the Golgochang alley on the stone bridge road. Gapchang alleys were formed as merchants who sold giblets at stalls in Guri Market started opening shops in one or two alleys. Besides 'Original Dr. Yuk Gopchang', 'Bobae Gopchang', 'Aunt' etc. are the restaurants serving as a touch on this place.

   Compared to other restaurants, Gapchang Alley is filled with the flavor of the common people. Guests are different depending on the time of day. Housewives come for lunch, students who finish class in the late afternoon, and office workers knock at the restaurant door to enjoy a giblet snack in a glass of soju in the late evening. In particular, the giblets here are popular with nearby youth. When students find it, they may add more so that they can eat full.

   The story of the eldest brother in the giblets house, 'Original Dr. Gopchang,' goes back more than 20 years. It was in 1987 that the owner started roasting giblets. The new house, which had just been married, packed a stall in the Guri market, and it was a giblet that was served as a snack at that time. Stir-fried giblets served with vegetables such as sesame leaves and cabbage were very popular among women at the time. Following the reputation of the time, this restaurant still boasts vegetable giblets as its main menu.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   At that time, the giblets were also cut with scissors. When the giblets were trimmed, the fingers were swollen, and the sewers were often clogged because the oil was greasy when the flour was washed with flour dough. Gopchang business is still very easy these days. The giblets also come in a cut state, and the inside is washed with water pressure.

   The owner, who started selling giblets at a stand, opened a restaurant specializing in giblets in 1992. It was in 2001 that it settled here. Nearby 'Bobae Gopchang' and 'Aunt' are also restaurants that have been keeping alleys since 2001. As the alley became famous, other restaurants entered the Onggi boil, making the stone bridge and giblets alley the way they are.

   The giblets here have several secrets to their taste. The point is to prepare fresh giblets. In principle, the restaurant serves a giblet twice a day and sells the same day. Grill the giblets until they are firm, and pour a little soju to remove the smell when baking. Mixing a little perilla oil also helps to remove the stink of the giblets. And the ripe giblets are diced in grass and wrapped in lettuce. Dipping in grass is a scenery rarely seen in other local giblets. During the stalls, it was fashionable to eat giblets and chojang together in most restaurants in the giblets alley after settling after seeing the customers eating and eating on the grass.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Over 20 years have passed from the stand to the giblets alley, so the preferences of regular customers are different. There are also parents who buy giblets here for children who come back from the country because they were deliberately forgetting their taste when they were regular students.
   <br/>
   "It's most rewarding when my friends who came as a student come here to dating and hug me later. Because I also sent my eldest daughter to college with a giblet business. If I think about having a child at home and alternately spending the night with my husband, My heart is salty. "
   <br/>
   Like the memories of the owner of Dr. Yu's Gopchang, the twisted giblets contain not only taste but also many stories and loves.

    In addition to sesame leaves and cabbages, the vegetable giblets, a specialty of the stone bridge, are rich in rice cakes and vermicelli. Sundae giblets and spicy bones that mix Sundae and giblets are also popular. The spicy giblet stir fry comes with seaweed sashimi on the table. If you've eaten giblets to some extent, it's another special thing to eat gongbitap. The price for one gopchang is 7,000 won, so the price is not too high. If you add an additional gong gimbap for 2 people, 2 to 3 people can fill the boat. On weekends and late afternoon, guests tend to be crowded, and parking is behind the giblets.
