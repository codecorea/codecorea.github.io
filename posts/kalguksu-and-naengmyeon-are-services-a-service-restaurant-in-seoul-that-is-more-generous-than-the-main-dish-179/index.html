    Namdaemun Market is the largest traditional market in Seoul, so there are many entrances. Among them, Exit 5 of Hoehyeon Station on Subway Line 4 is the starting point to meet famous restaurants in Namdaemun Market. From the entrance to Namdaemun Market, restaurants that boast 50 years of history are hidden in alleys that are entangled like a spider's web along the main road. In addition to the 50-year-old joy of ruining the 70-year-old tail gomtang restaurant, Gangwon House, which has been loved as a chicken gomtang since 1962, and Namdaemun Market's Galchijorim alley, there are rows of royal feet, hand-wheat dumplings, and vegetable hotteok. There is a myriad of food and jujeon beak.

  <div class="txt_p">
   In front of Exit 5 of Hoehyeon Station, there is a kalguksu alley full of people who want to taste good kalguksu all year round. When you open a shabby plastic door and enter, more than 10 small kalguksu gather on both sides to seduce guests with the smell of anchovy soup. Kalguksu, which boils fiercely in dozens of pots with steaming steam, has the power to soften the tension that has been stuck in the daily life. It is a moment to meet the good price of a bowl of rice or kalguksu and the virtue of an infinite refill service.

   It is frowned upon by the enthusiasm of the enthusiasm from the entrance, saying that if you order the rice, you can taste Kalguksu on cold noodles. Namhae Restaurant of three sisters who do not lose their smile even in the alley of Kalguksu, which forms a buksaetong, has secured the longest table after 25 years. Half of the happy customers are regulars over a decade old. Ten people and 20 people are sitting on the chair. In a good-hearted store, will the customers' feelings be too full? If you sit down in a narrow enough place to hit the shoulders and order a bowl of rice, there is no chance to complain because the side dishes and miso soup come out with kalguksu and cold noodles.

   Kalguksu noodles, which are kneaded by dozens of times as a restaurant specializing in Kalguksu, are cut into thin pieces by hand, and the shape is also jagged and thin, but even if it's arbitrary, it tastes chewy. The rich anchovy broth is served with plenty of savory spicy sauce and served with a spicy and refreshing seasoning. The feeling of satiety comes in a few times. It is impossible to have a leisurely meal because of people standing in a narrow alley with a folding screen. However, if you are ready for a tough table setting in a crowded market place, you can taste rice, kalguksu and cold noodles in one room. It also packs the leftover rice with a large amount. It costs 6,000 won for rice, 5,000 won for kalguksu, cold noodles and barley. Business hours from 6 am to 9 pm, closed on holidays

   The crossroads in front of City Hall are busy throughout the day with the steps of office workers. When the sun begins to flap, a long line begins to form in the narrow alleyway of City Hall Station Exit 8. It is a procession of guests who want to enter the “satisfaction” that netizens and gourmets have chosen as the three major jokbals in Seoul.

   After 6 pm, the sound of a number tag from the waiting machine at the door of the restaurant is bustling. For those looking for food, the long line is a warm-up space where the food is full of excitement. It is time to shake off the subjective taste and prejudice of others and prepare an empty stomach appropriately. You should also be prepared to wait more than 30 minutes between 6 and 8 pm.

   'Satisfaction' created a menu called 'Ohyangjokbal' when the owner's hand tasted Jokbal when he ran a Chinese restaurant in the past. Ten or so ingredients such as octagon, sancho, cinnamon, and ohyang were added to the jokbal to catch the smell of meat and bring out the unique taste of the ohhyang jokbal. If you make a jokbal, the pot of Mangukguk first takes its place. It is a visual that the egg soup served with fried rice overlaps.

   In the hot pot, chewy rice cake soup and Chinese water dumplings are floating in the east.

   When a delicious jokbal comes out in a heavy banquet, the real value of Manguk-guk begins to show up. There is no shrimp sauce, ssam vegetables, and kimchi on the table of 'satisfaction'. Instead, vegetables, radish vegetables, and garlic sauce come out. Garlic sauce with a sweet and sour taste is a special sauce that is moistened with cabbage and put on a jokbal. Since it is a mildly strong jokbal, it goes well with the spicy garlic sauce, but it is more likely to taste when eaten with boiled manguk soup. The feeling of jokbal, a clump of collagen, goes down neatly in a hot and cool broth. Soft dumplings and chewy rice cake soup are enough for one meal. The jokbal has a feeling that tteokman-guk soup is hotter than spicy makguksu.
