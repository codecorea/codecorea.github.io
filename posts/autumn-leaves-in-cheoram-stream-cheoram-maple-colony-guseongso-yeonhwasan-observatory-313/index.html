    Overlooking the low-carbon black mountain where the coals have formed. The autumn leaves that bloom from the east of Taebaek City to the north and south of the rock cliffs of Cheoram Stream are rich. There is a gateway and a parcel gate leading to the utopia where there is no disaster and no war in the siperon stream flowing through the cliff. At the center of Taebaek Yeonhwasan Dulle-gil Observatory, you can see Taebaek and end your day trip.

    The best way to get to Taebaek is Dumun-dong. Dumun-dong is the lowest point between the 1,400m class Geumdaebong and Eundaebong, and its height is 1,268m. The mountain path from Geumdaebong to Geomryongso, the birthplace of the Han River, limits the number of people per day, and is a wildflower paradise as a nature reserve. The mountain path that started from Eundaebong passes through Hambaeksan and leads to Manhangjae, known as the heavenly garden.
    <br/>
    If you are at the border and gateway of a city, at least this is the best way to get in and out. If you want to go to Taebaek, don't go into the Dumun-dongjae tunnel, but enjoy the old story of Taebaek, spreading and descending as you climb up and down the old hillside road.

    Another name of Dumun Dongjae is Sarijae. It is a name given to many saffrons. There was a legendary sage tree in Sarijae, where the mountain collapsed in the heavy rain, the sali tree was uprooted and floated, and then hit the rock cliff of the phrase, breaking through the cliff.
    <br/>
    Reduces the speed of kicking down a winding downhill like a frosty tree floating in the flood. The color of the leaves of Cheonuibong, which is like a bright red color, is beautiful. There was a market stall in that way. On the 5th, 15th, and 25th, the market was held three times a month.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The leader is not a permanent market. If there is no market, no one sells, no one lives. However, when the market is standing, it is crowded with people. Agricultural products and industrial products are packed. Boil the soup in a cauldron, and people gather. The tents that cover the sky line up. The awning of the tent fluttering in the wind makes the market alive. The face of the couple who came out of the ‘Long Kyeong-Kyung’ pushing the stroller is full of laughter. The mobile pub, which has been crowded since daylight, is a licorice that does not fall into the marketplace. An octopus from Samcheok waits for its owner, and a mackerel who is on the dinner table tonight is lying side by side with a blue back.

   After seeing the marketplace, he fills his stomach with a bowl of soup and climbs the full-scale Taebaek journey. Take the city bus from Gyeongdong Apt. Stop around Tonglijang to Cheolam Elementary School bus stop.

   It's not now, but during the coal boom, Taebaek was a black city. The stream was black, the ground was black, and even the air seemed black. Autumn leaves bloom in such a place, so the Cheoram Maple Colony is just there.
   <br/>
   You can see only autumn leaves along the cliffs of Byeongpung Rock, Cheoramcheon. Children who carry backpacks and play in the stream will be Cheolam Elementary School students. I greet you first with a smile, but for some reason it's strange. Even in front of the camera, laughter is still natural. The backdrop of the autumnal leaves spread behind the children and the children are the main characters.

    Crossing the bridge leads to the mountain. It is better to see the autumn leaves colored by streams and cliffs. I take my steps back and stand in front of the autumn leaves again. If the leaves of Cheonuibong are a beautiful light, the leaves of Cheoramcheon resemble the hearts of deep and serious people.

   Watch the autumn leaves and move your foot toward Cheoram Station. Behind Cheoram Station is the so-called 'coal acid'. This is the Cheoram Station. Once the coal sorting work is done here, it is loaded onto a train and transported across the country. During the Japanese colonial period, the coal was transported from here to Mukho Port and taken to Japan.

   There is a Taebaek Paleozoic Natural History Museum next to the gate. The terrain here originated about 150 million to 300 million years ago. Traces of wave, salt, and trilobite creatures, such as trilobites, have been found in the rising, twisted, and broken rocks. This is evidence that it was the sea. The landscape of the current phraseo was completed after rising through the fluctuation of the earth's crust and weathering and erosion.

    The story of living in a beautiful scenery is also desperate. If you look inside the cliff cave, there is the phrase 'Obokdongcheonjagaemun'. There is a story entangled in this passage. When you climb to the top of the Nakdong River, there is a stone gate that can no longer be climbed. It opens at midnight (11:00 PM-1:00 AM) and closes during the holidays (1 AM-3 AM). The person who passes through this stone gate at that time enters a world without ill-feeling, anger, and without disaster and sickness. ' That stone gate is the phrase soda. Taebaek was a land free of ugliness and anger. People's origins for Lee Sang-hyang were eager. Sit in Jajaru, a pavilion on the top of the parlor, and listen to the sound of flowing water.

   Although Yeonhwasan rose in the center of Taebaek City, there is no presence. Because of the 1,400 ~ 1,500m-class mountains, including Taebaeksan, Hambaeksan, Eundaebong, Geumdaebong, and Cheonuibong, which surround Taebaek City, the 1,171m Yeonhwasan Mountain has become a mountain behind the town. The name is Yeonhwasan because the mountain looks like a lotus. The end of the day's journey is walking along the Yeonhwasan Trail.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   There are several locations around Yeonhwasan Dulle-gil, but it follows the road next to the main entrance of the Women's Hall. As you climb the stairs, you'll see a dirt road piled up with fallen leaves. When you go up the mountain slope, there is the Ormmo Springs. It is about 500m from the main entrance of the Women's Hall. From here, the path to the top of Yeonhwasan Mountain, Oknyebong, and the path to Yeonhwasan Dulle-gil Observatory are separated. Step towards the Observatory. It is 1.2 km to the observation deck.
