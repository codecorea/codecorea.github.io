   Did you go 10km from Songchu IC on the Seoul Outer Ring Expressway? A mountain temple sits nicely beneath the ridge of the eagle, with its wings spread. Jin Gwan-sa, the successor of Sinhyeolsa Temple, was built in 1011 by King Hyunjong, the eighth king of Goryeo, who was built for the monk Jin Gwan who protected him from the fall of Queen Cheonchu.

   Unlike any mountain temple where you have to drive into the parking lot for a long time, Jingwansa Temple is near the parking lot and the temple. The mother-like officer walks out to the front door and asks the visitor 'Come on'. After passing through Iljumun, there is a Gukrak Bridge in front of Haetalmun, which raised the roof of Pajak. If you cross this bridge, you will be in the grounds of Jingwansa. There is a well-maintained wooden deck path next to the bridge. Although it is about 100m short, it is the treasure trail of Jingwansa where you can experience the cool greenery of Jingwansa Valley. Be sure to walk when entering or leaving the temple.

   The fact that Jin Gwan-sa, which was greatly lost in the Korean War, now looks like the work of Jin Gwan, who came to Governor of 1963 and Gho Ho, the current Governor of 2006, was appointed. As both are Bhikkhunis, Jingwansa is a graceful temple where 13-minute Bhikkuni monks care for the temple. Jingwansa's peculiar delicacy and coziness have this connection and karma.

   When you cross the Gukrak Bridge and go up to the center of Jingwansa Temple, you meet Sesimgyo Bridge, the bridge that washes your mind. There is a prison in front of the bridge, and the second floor of the prison is a bomunwon where you can chat with a monk. On the left side of the prison is Yeonjiwon, where you can taste traditional tea. With tea, people, and small laughter and stories, this is the cultural space of Jingwansa. By lowering the threshold of the temple, it was created as a place where anyone can come and drink a cup of fragrant tea. The meaning in the amount of annual support is valuable. 'Songpungja's name (松風 煮茗)' means that the tea buds are brewed with a breeze.

Do not use onions, such as green onions, garlic, leek, soy sauce, and onions in temple food. Then what taste do you eat? It seems that the difference in food between Jinhae Temple and Jingwansa Temple was analyzed. Jingwansa's intestines have a mellow taste and make the most of the unique texture of the ingredients.

   The secret of Jingwansa Temple food is timing and mind rather than skill. Governor Gyeho Ho, who has been studying temple food for a long time, chose 'clean, flexible, and method' as the three principles of temple food. It boils and boils seasonal vegetables as they are, making them carefully prepared according to the Buddha's teachings. Sam Kass, Senior Advisor and Vice-Chairman of the White House's Nutrition Policy, whether it was a fresh cultural stimulus for the Gentiles, will experience the food of the temple in Jingwansa in 2015.

   In fact, it is difficult to handle the profoundness and strictness of eating food at temples, that is, approaching 'gongyang' as a Buddhist doctrine. Buddhism teaching in every act of preparing food and eating it is so heavy that it cannot be followed. "The existence of one body is created by eating, and disappears through eating." "Where did this food come from? I am ashamed to receive it by virtue of my virtues. I receive this offering to get rid of all kinds of greed in my heart and to make a profession by knowing it as a medicine that supports this body." Uneasy. Can you follow me with every meal? To do that, you will have to go home. From the pagan interpretation, the Buddhist temple food is an alternative to the paradox of abundance, and I think it is a message that Buddhism throws in this era. Isn't it a personalized missionary missionary for the modern people who are taking the price of human greed packed with richness such as high fat, high calorie, and high protein?

   The difference and competitiveness of Jingwansa Temple food is that it is 'good and delicious'. It's not stimulating, it's not boring, it's definitely fresh, but it doesn't feel like it is lacking. It would be because it filled something empty with something else. Haphae Monk, the general secretary of Jin Gwan-sa, called it 'Jung Sung' "So the rice that my mother gave me is delicious," she said.

   There is no reason why the 'heart' provider is not necessarily a mother. On July 15th (Sat) and August 19th (Sat), Jingwansa will hold the 'Happy Sansa Food Learned by Dad' program. The first experience was completed successfully in June. Dads who participated in feeding and experiencing good things for their children were hot. It consists of an experience where you can make and taste Sansa food yourself and share a conversation with a monk. Participation fee is free! Dad must participate and 2 people can participate. It is highly recommended as the best must-have item for children with this summer vacation.

   Jingwansa's National Amphibious Property (Important Intangible Cultural Heritage No. 126) is a representative Buddhist ritual and a great history and culture content. Amphibious is a Buddhist ritual that preaches and provides illegal food to lonely souls and devils who wander in water and water. Jingwansa's national amphibious material was led and sponsored by the royal family directly after the Joseon Dynasty established an amphibious company in Jingwansa and provided amphibious materials. In the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, it is confirmed that the amphibious ash was carried out at Jingwansa until the Yeonsan army.

   Jingwansa's amphibious materials are the only two-day and nighttime materials. If you want to experience the formal beauty of the comprehensive arts of Buddhism, you may want to participate in the amphibious goods of Jingwansa held in October every year.
