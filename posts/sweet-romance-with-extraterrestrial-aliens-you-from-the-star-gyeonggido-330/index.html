   Dear love on ice, Jangam Reservoir

  <div class="txt_p">
   &lt;My Love from the Star&gt; says Cheon Song-yi (Jeon Ji-hyun) in the 10th Epilogue.
   <br/>
   “Can dependence turn into love? I rely on Chimac. When I'm depressed, I always find my pulse. That doesn't make you excited about the chicken legs. But this is fluttering. If my heart is pounding and my lips are burning and I can't see in front of my eyes, I'm anxious. … . ”
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   There are dramas that come with occasional electric power (!). It is an excitement that seems to have met old love by accident. This is the magic that makes Gear sit in front of the TV CRT. Like “chimaek” when you are depressed! Of course, there are thrills that chicken legs cannot give.
   <br/>
   &lt;My Love from the Star&gt; starts with a strange record in the 20th Annals of the Joseon Dynasty. It is a statement that in 1609 several unidentified objects were seen in a simultaneous bundle. It is the setting that the aliens who settled there live in Seoul after 400 years. In addition, the love story of the alien Do Min-jun (Kim Soo-hyun) and the alien star, the top star Cheon Song-i, added from the star. The ‘Chemie’ has a addictive sensation of veins. Thanks to this, I was able to record a high rating of 20 ~ 30% all the time. Above all, the gem-like lines and the picturesque scenes that match it are indispensable. That is why it is more interested in filming locations than any other movie or drama. When you write in that place, you have a feeling of deception, as if you were in “Your Star”.

  <div class="txt_p">
   It was the ice fishing spot that appeared in the 11th. 'Donmin Joon's response to his confession,' I can't believe, is that 'the first woman in Korea, a woman who wants to be dating, is a woman who wants to date.' So, I'm going to accompany Do Min-joon's fishing trip to check again. Do-min Doo puts a tent on the ice reservoir, breaks the ice and prepares for fishing. Cheonsong-yi, who came out like a child, enjoys it like a child and jumps on a snow-capped reservoir. It looks like a lover. Then Do Min-joon asks.
   <br/>
   “Are you really here to hear my answer?”
   <br/>
   Chun Song-i once again conveys her heart.
   <br/>
   “No, I want to be with you. But I also want to hear the answer. ”

   The scene left a deep impression due to the shadow of love turning lonely on a romantic snowy field. The filming location is Jangam Reservoir in the Gukmanbong Natural Recreation Forest in Pocheon. Gukmanbong Natural Recreation Forest is relatively less known than other recreational forests in Gyeonggi-do. It is a place only for those who know it as a private recreation forest. Jangam Reservoir is particularly attractive. I have to walk up about 10 minutes from the entrance, but it is an unexpected gift. It quickly takes away the gaze from the lakes and valleys to the unstoppable peaks. The shadow of Gobong is young on the lake and captures the flavor of the season. The main characters are greenery in spring and summer, and leaves like fireworks in autumn. In winter, it is a frozen country on a frozen ice. The frozen ice lake makes the gear take a small step even if it is not even a tent. The small steps resemble the love of Cheon Song-i and Do Min-jun. The filming was done in winter, but it is the beginning of spring. The warm energy gently wipes out the marks of winter. Nevertheless, the snowfall in the shade conveys the afterglow of &lt;You from the Star&gt;.

   If you still feel regretful, we recommend walking around or staying at a log cabin. At the foot of the mountain alongside the lake, there are 630,000 evergreen trees and pine trees, including pine trees and pine trees. There are also several log houses in its arms. After a day, you can listen to the hymn of a star at the shore of the night like a drama. On the late night when Song Song-i left, Do Min-joon called Jang Jang, a lawyer who couldn't hide his empty heart, and took my heart out.
   <br/>
   “How does it feel to grow old together? I want to grow old together (with Cheon Song-i). ”
   <br/>
   The 11th epilogue unfolds a hidden event that did not appear in the main story. Do-min Do-joon, who has stopped time, sneaks up to Cheon Song-i. Without knowing this, Chun Song-i is alone with heartburn. It is a sweet reversal on the snowy ice lake.

   A week after &lt;You from the Star&gt; was aired, KBS drama &lt;Emotional Age&gt; of the same time period also visited Jangam Reservoir. This is a scene where Kim Ok-ryeon (Jin Se-yeon) and Kim Soo-ok (Kim Jae-wook) are skating with Shin Jeong-tae (Kim Hyun-jung). The two hit the ice as if they were playing a waltz with a twist. Even though the times, backgrounds, and channels are different, romance is one thing.

   Every new life history. The situation is reversed after Cheon Song-i's accident. This time, Do-min Do-joon conveys his heart to Cheon Song-i and waits for her answer. The 15th is the filming scene of Cheon Song-i's film, which has fallen from the lead role to the supporting role. It is a sweet love story like Cheon Song-i, who was left alone all night trying to film a god and Domin-Jun's cotton candy, waiting for her.

   The two who have confirmed their love after shooting Petite France continue their warm days. Among them, in the 16th, there is a scene where Cheon Song-yi shoots a second film with a friend and rival Semi. On the director's ‘NG’ sign, Cheon Song-i throws herself several times in the forest and rolls over and over again. Along with this scene, the scene where Cheon Song-i borrowed Domin-Jun's superpowers during the waiting time to take a shot in the same place was also filmed. The forest is located in the background of the small forest in Paju.

   Soryeongwon is a historical site No. 358, the tomb of Sukjong of Joseon Dynasty and the tomb of Sukbin Choi, the birth mother of Yeongjo. She is a real person in the drama &lt;Dongi&gt;. At the head of the trees, trees grow high and form a forest. So it is also called Major Forest. The grave of Yeongjo's concubine, Jeong Bin Lee, is also a grave. However, Lieutenant General Soo Gil and Su Gilwon were closed. This is because it is not opened to protect cultural properties. Fortunately, the filming took place at the end of the forest path inside the side road, not as a small institute. It is a restaurant called “In the Forest of Soryeongwon”. It is a house with a wide yard at the end of a coniferous forest road. Here are two people burning a bonfire late at night. Cheon Song-i, who has just begun to love, is an ordinary lover, not a top star. On the 100th day, you want to hang the key after having dinner at the restaurant at the top of Namsan Tower, and on the 1000th, it is a normal date to plan an overseas trip to go together.

   Indeed, Major Major is nothing but a short forest path. It is also a restaurant and private property in the Soryeongwon Forest, so there are restrictions on access. For this reason, it is recommended to connect to the nearby Bogwangsa Temple. Bogwangsa Temple is a temple that has nothing to do with Major Major. Here is the idea of enshrining Young-jung and the deputy of Sookbin Choi buried in a small house.
