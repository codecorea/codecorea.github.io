   The road trip in Gangwon-do is lyrical. When viewed from a distance, it has a river that seems to stop and sparkle and a museum that resembles a calm river. The place where people gather along the river naturally stands and is full of food. That's why my trip is full of excitement. Let's go on a road trip to Gangwon-do, where you can travel like a river and fill your heart and enjoy the taste.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Road trip begins at Nami Island floating on the Bukhan River. Travelers are famous for the drama 'Winter Sonata' and become accustomed to it. The attraction of Nami Island is that it makes you feel as if you have traveled abroad in Korea. So I don't know if it's called Naminara. There are two ways to enter Nami Island. 5 minutes by boat, or a straw wire, 30-40 km per hour to fly in 1 minute 30 seconds.

   Stepping into the Republic of Naminara, you will see a forest of trees stretching high into the sky. If you walk along the cool shade, you will find a picture book playground, a restaurant, Metasequoia Road, and a hotel Jeonggwanru. You can walk as slowly as you can, or rent a bicycle or electric car to explore every corner. Cycling rides along the Metasequoia Road, Fir Road, Ginkgo Road and Birch Road in the wind, and the summer heat is forgotten.

   The place where many tourists are attracted is the location of Winter Sonata. The metasequoia road, which looks like a scene from a foreign movie, and the place where Bae Yong-jun and Choi Ji-woo make and kiss a snowman are essential courses for lovers who dream of a romantic trip.
   <br/>
   If you are with your children, I recommend you to stop by the picture book playground where picture books are placed on a large bookshelf that extends up to the ceiling of the second floor. There are more than 20,000 children's books on the first floor, and there are more than 5,000 picture books from 86 countries on the second floor.

   Also remember that Nami Island has a tomb of General Nami. Nami Island was originally a land belonging to Chuncheon City, and it became an island when the Cheongpyeong Dam was built in 1944. Nami spent his life in exile in Nami Island, reversing the conspiracy as a mother of Yu Ja-gwang. Today's tomb is a mystery, and the actual tomb is in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi-do.

   If you know that Nami Island is in Chuncheon, you should put chicken ribs in your itinerary. "If you come to Chuncheon do not eat chicken ribs does not mean come to Chuncheon," remember the saying of the travelers. There are many restaurants that display 'Chuncheon Chicken Ribs' sign everywhere in the big city, but it's not comparable to eating in Chuncheon. You will have to try Chuncheon Chicken Ribs before moving on to other destinations. Chuncheon chicken ribs are two kinds. There are chicken ribs grilled over charcoal and grilled chicken ribs with plenty of vegetables on the iron plate. The beginning of Chuncheon Chicken Ribs was to grill on charcoal, but with the spread of thick teppanyaki, the teppanyaki style became popular.

Any type of chicken ribs wrapped in lettuce with plenty of meat and vegetables, and served with Makguksu will complete Chuncheon's delicacy.

   The water garden filled with calm water has a Seosan Haemistone on the floor that turns black when it touches the water. The calm water contains the sky, so the steps leading to the entrance of the exhibition hall seem to be walking in the air. Walk slowly and admire the formation of the lines and sculptures of the building reflected in the water depending on the angle of light. There is a work by James Turrell who works on the theme of light. It is an exhibition where you can experience a new perspective on light and space.

   There is a Bongpyeongjang that is the background of the novel. It is a permanent market, but on the day of the month 2 and 7, the oil market opens and the market is noisy. It is true that Bongpyeongjang, which has a 400-year history, has been in decline since the times changed. However, the local people joined forces to preserve the tradition and renovated. Tents and aprons were made by colorizing five items, agricultural products, seafood, food, clothing, and sundries. The merchants also made displays and made plates that marked the country of origin for the customers to see. Proud to show off signs and business cards with a merchant's face. On the day of the oil stand, there are about 100 shops, and there are many buckwheat restaurants near Bongpyeongjang.
