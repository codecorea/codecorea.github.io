    Remembrance Day and June, which embraced June 25, are the month of the Veterans' Day. Perhaps it is because of our ancestors who fought everything to protect the country that we can suffer from personal concerns such as dating, employment, and marriage. Before and after June 25th, how about remembering your ancestors for a few days and having a thankful heart? With that in mind, I visited the Yongsan War Memorial.

   One day when the big and small fights between South and North continued around the 38th parallel, the dawn of June 25, 1950, North Korea went on a surprise attack before dawn. After that, the support of the Soviet Union was promised. South Korea, which lacks proper military training and equipment, is faced with helplessness. I broke the Hangang bridge and earned time, but it was pushed to the Nakdong River defense line. However, General MacArthur's Incheon Landing Operation (September 15, 1950) returned to Seoul in three months and recaptured Pyongyang and quickly advanced to the Yalu River.

In particular, the 'Incheon Landing Operation 4D Experience Hall (7 minutes of screening time, 15 people watching once)' and 4D Realistic Video Room (9 minutes of screening time, 40 people watching once) 'show severe weather through 4D video, vibration, and blizzard effects.
