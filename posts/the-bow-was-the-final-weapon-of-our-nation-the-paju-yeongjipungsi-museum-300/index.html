   "It's a small weapon, but it has a long range, and it's also a weapon to be wary of."
   <br/>
   This is an article about our traditional bows expressed in an ancient Chinese book. The power of the palace was so great that one person was able to deal with dozens of people. The movie &lt;The Final Weapon Bow&gt; shows how well our people shot the bow and how frightening and powerful it was as a weapon.

   A bow that cannot be separated from our people. Paju's Yeongjipungsi Museum is where you can see and learn everything about the bow. Archery refers to arches and poetry, that is, bows and arrows. It is the first archery museum in Korea to show the traditional bows and arrows of Korea and Europe and Asia, as well as Korean traditional bows. Various archaeological artifacts are exhibited, including bows and arrows, crossbows, various tools for archery, and foreign bows.

   The road to Yeongjipungsi Museum. My heart flutters. I was wondering what kind of bow was used by our ancestors who were famous for shooting well, and whether there was really an unusual arrow that Jushinta (Ryu Seung-ryong) from Qing Dynasty in the movie &lt;The Final Weapon Bow&gt;.

   The Yeongjip Palace Museum, which arrived after the Heyri Art Village, is smaller than expected. There are few exhibits, and the conditions, such as facilities, are rather awkward. Even if it is a private museum, it is difficult to hide the disappointment if you see only the appearance. However, the museum's true value can only be seen by looking inside. He said, "I can see as much as I know."

   At the Yeongjip Palace Museum, the narrator accompanies and explains in detail how and how to make traditional bows, and the differences from European or Asian bows at eye level. The narrator is full of pride in the traditional bow, and he feels good about his detailed description and sincerity. If you look at the exhibits while listening to explanations, you will be proud of our culture.

   Bows are used around the world, but each has its own characteristics. The first European longbow that stands out in the museum is only plausible to see straight, but practical. The British longbow splits the resilient yew tree, which has a short range compared to the fact that it takes a lot of effort to pull the protest. The long bow makes it difficult to carry, making it difficult to shoot on a horse or in the woods. The same goes for the Japanese bow made of bamboo. Made from one material with low elasticity is called simple palace.

   Our bow is a composite arch, which is a composite arch that combines various materials with short and resilient length. A buffalo horn was attached to a bamboo or mulberry tree, and the iron wire that acts as a spring was finely chopped, and then around and inside to add elasticity. The curled bow you can see in the exhibition room is our bow. When in use, bend the bow to the opposite side to protest. As a result, it is clearly different from the bow of other countries in resilience. Elasticity is proportional to the bow's penetration and range. Our bows send arrows from 300 to 400m, while the western bows only reach half of them.

   Among the exhibits, Shinkijeon, a gunpowder weapon, also stands out. It is a secret weapon of Joseon that was able to fire 100 arrows at a time. In the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, it was recorded that Singijeon played a large role in the war to reclaim our land from the Yeojin of the Yalu River and sub-Tuman River in the early Joseon Dynasty. Unfortunately, Shingijeon, which was a cutting-edge science weapon in the 15th century, disappeared with the development of a cannon, a kind of cannon.

   There is also a baby weapon (convenience), a secret weapon of the Joseon Dynasty. It is about 30cm, about half the size of an arrow, and shoots in a bucket called Tong-A, which is divided into half. It is said that even if the baby's flesh was blown away, Tong-ah remained intact, and even if the enemy tried to reuse the arrow, it did not fit the bow. The speed of the flight is also high, so you will not notice the arrow flying and die.

    If you learned about bows and arrows in the showroom, it's time to go out and pull the bow. You can learn how to shoot a bow and experience shooting a bow at the bow site provided at the Yeongjipung Palace Museum. Unlike archery, which draws protests with the index finger and middle finger, the archery holds the arrow with the thumb and holds it as if wrapped around it. The hand with the bow is also slightly tilted towards the body. The archery lesson is only 5 minutes. It's that easy and simple. Anyone can learn to shoot for a while and try to shoot.
