   The journey begins with daily life. It is because you feel inspiration from the moment you see something familiar, and it is identified with the excitement you experience in an unfamiliar destination. For example, Yongsan Printing Industrial Complex, which goes by way of work, and the national office that stops on the way home. It's so common that you just listen to the extraordinary things that are hidden in them. Maybe this is the best place to forget the cold wind this winter.

   Exit the South Area Exit 1 and cross the road once in the direction of Yongsan The Prime from the crossroad. The old name of this place is Namyoung-dong Printing Corporation. At one time it was noisy with the sound of a three-wheeled motorcycle carrying printed materials, but as time passed, most print shops moved to Paju Publishing Complex, where the phenomenon of cavitation quickly progressed. Of course, there was a chance of change. The redevelopment winds in Yongsan have begun building high-rise buildings one by one around. However, due to the delay in redevelopment of the printing complex, the old buildings were left untouched.

   Eul-san's printing industry has regained its vitality since the winter of 2014, when a young shopkeeper made up of members in their mid-20s. Founders, who lacked a good business source, took the place as a pioneer, where rents could be relatively cheap but they could carry nearby high-class apartment residents on their backs and form new business.

   With the vision of making this place a street for youth traders, they opened several restaurants with different types of food and interior. There are five youth malls that remain to date, including 'Temple's Yakiniku', 'Temple Zukkumi', 'Cheolin 28', 'Chicken Revolution' and 'Potato House'. Upon hearing that the old alley has been filled with youth's ambitions, the number is increased to dozens of other restaurants. Office workers began to fill the streets on weekdays and family guests on weekends. The lottery that the youth expected was a good burst.

   The active attitude of the employees is in line with the fact that young shopkeepers emphasize service as the biggest virtue. All of these belong to young shopkeepers, not limited to any one shop, so they pursue common values. Therefore, there is no sense of heterogeneity even if there is not enough work place in one place, and the help of other store staff comes to help. Employees seem to consider this kind attitude and service spirit the greatest weapon of enthusiasm. One of the first-time grilled employees said with a joke, "We're all passionate," but looking back, I feel that it's not overwhelming at all.

   The menu is simple. Anchovy noodles, bibim noodles, gimbap and water dumplings are all but the most expensive is cheap enough not to exceed 5,000 won. Usually women do not forget to ask for a small amount while ordering. Those who have not been sealed by their grandmother may not easily understand. As the business hours are from 7 pm to 4 am, a lot of taxi drivers came to the store, and the owner's grandmother explained that the sheep had grown as much as he was trying to take more care. Gimbap, which is as popular as noodles, is so big that it's hard to eat in a bite.
