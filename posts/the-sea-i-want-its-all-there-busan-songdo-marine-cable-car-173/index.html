   The seas of Busan we know are about Haeundae, Gwangalli, and Taejongdae. Song-do? His head is smiling with a question mark. But it is reverse. The middle-aged parents' generation hit Songdo first, rather than Haeundae. Turning the time back 50 years ago, the best beach in Busan in the 1960s is the Songdo Beach. At that time, Haeundae couldn't even give out a business card, so Songdo is visible again.

   Songdo Beach was opened in 1913. It holds the title of Korea's first public beach. When Songdo Beach was in full swing, there were four specialties. Cable cars, bridges, diving platforms and cruise ships. The nation's greatest reputation began to fall due to environmental pollution in the 1970s. In 1987, the typhoon Selma was overwhelmed, the bridge and the diving platform collapsed completely, and the cable car stopped operating the following year.

   Songdo is now regaining its glory. The cable car began to fly again, and a nice cloud trail over the bridge was placed over the sea. In the middle of the sea, a large turtle-shaped diving platform appeared, as well as a promenade along the sea that was not available in those days, making Songdo's day more full.

   Songdo Beach, the superstar of the old year, was crushing at first sight. I love the dazzling blue sea and the wide, fine beaches that look like a half moon. People who plunge into the sea and are walking along the waves crashing in the white, regretting the summer going, each enjoys Songdo Beach.

   The small island on the eastern end of the beach is Turtle Island. A cloud trail runs across the sea past Turtle Island. A shelter in the shape of a ship is decorated at the entrance, and in the photo zone of the bow, there is a lover who creates the scene of the movie Titanic. As you enter the promenade, the sea spreads smoothly on both sides. Looking to the right is the sea, and looking to the left is the sea. Even down the sea is visible. The bottom of the bridge is made of tempered glass, so the sea is soft. It is literally a scene where a miracle walks on the sea.

   Total length is 365m. It is a sufficient distance to enjoy the sea in a relaxed manner. Turtle Island has small attractions such as turtle sculptures, and it is good to take a break from the sea breeze. After passing the turtle island, the promenade stretches 100m towards the sea. At the end, I'm dyed to the depths of my chest.

   Now it's time to go take the cable car offshore, but Mount Geumgang is also around. Not far from the Cloud Trail, there is a 100-year Songdo Alley. Inside the alley, there are various restaurants from old wheat noodles to new pasta houses.

   If you push it, it will quickly remove the subtraction and finally take the marine cable car. I was in agony for a while before riding. Riding a regular cable car or a crystal cruise with a transparent bottom. Aside from the fear of heights, I chose Crystal Cruise. After spending a lot of time in a long line of realization of popularity, I finally climbed the cable car.

  <div class="txt_p">
   There is a coastal walkway from Amnam Park with an upper stop to Songdo Beach. You can use a round trip, but that is why you bought a ticket one way. The Coastal Trail is a designated spot for Busan National Geopark. You can walk along the deck path and see the sedimentary rocks accumulated 100 million years ago. The sound of waves lays in the background while meeting the plump geology and admiring the open sea. It takes 30 minutes to reach the Songdo Beach, but it is difficult to resist the temptation when you meet the way down the middle and middle coast. When many ships are immersed in the landscape of the Songdo coast where they anchored, it is timeless.
