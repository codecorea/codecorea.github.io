   Yangrim-dong, Gwangju, Jeollanam-do, is a time machine travel destination to the past. Gwangju is a popular destination for modern history, and there is another time travel destination that evokes old memories. The penguin village is also very interesting. Although penguins do not live, there are many other eye-catching things to see. It is a place that emerges as a unique destination in time travel.

   The alleyway next to the Yangrim Community Center is a secret passageway leading to the time of the 1970s and 1980s. It is small and narrow enough to be easily overlooked, if not carefully examined. From the moment you find a penguin made of recycled gas cylinders at the entrance to the alley, the memories of the penguin town begins with a smile.

   The old, shabby wall scenery that appeared as soon as one step into the penguin village jumped the time back a decade. The old, dark stained concrete fence is filled with all sorts of graffiti written in the old movers center advertisement, town map, and colored chalk. After a few more steps, I stop at all and burst into laughter. The amount of pan should be in the kitchen, and frying pans and colanders glisten as if they were sunbathing.

   Why is the name Penguin Village ?!
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   At this point, we cannot help but wonder why the village name is 'Penguin Village'. The Penguin Village contains the characteristics of this village, which has a high age among residents, including the elderly living alone. The old man's walking image resembled a penguin that was faltering and was called as an alias, and it became the name of the village. It is an affectionate nickname to make the atmosphere of a quiet village more enjoyable and energetic.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Along with the nickname, the Penguin Village began to look like it is now about 5 years ago. It started with Kim Dong-gyun, the self-proclaimed mayor of this village, decorating and decorating his hometown as a hobby with all sorts of old objects and junk stuff piled up in a vacant neighborhood. In the meantime, as the residents brought together the old objects they had and worked together to build a village, the garbage here became a great driving force for the time travel. It's all used in real life, so it makes me feel better. Perhaps this is the charm of Penguin Village. The ordinary town was reborn as a time machine travel destination, one of the hot places these days due to the 'conversion of ideas'.
