    In August 2013, Gyeongsangnam-do submitted a “Application for List of UNESCO World Heritage Temporary Lists” under the heading “Gimhae, Gaya Tumulus in Haman”. The Gaya Tumulus Cluster in Haman, which is trying to be registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was very unfamiliar. Although the area called Haman is an unfamiliar place as a travel destination, the Hagan Gaya Tumulus Cluster is unfamiliar. The term Haman Gaya Tumulus Cluster refers to the mountain tomb cluster. In addition to Geumgwan Gaya, it is the remains of Aragaya, which represents Gaya culture. When it comes to Gaya culture, Gimhae and Goryeong are first thought of, but the Haman Malisan Tumulus Cluster is an open-air museum comparable to the tombs of Gyeongju.

   The easiest way to access the Malisan Tumulus Cluster (Historic Site No. 515), which was built at the hillside of Mt. It is close to Gaya-eup and has good accessibility. I thought about where to climb, so I stopped by the Haman Museum and chose the way to go to Mt. It is from the thought that the first thing to solve is the question of the history of Aragaya and the reality of the horse mound.

   Dolmen and dolmens and cartwheels that are larger than the actual size are displayed outside the Haman Museum. They are all artifacts from the Haman region. Some have reproduced the inside of the tomb. Restoring the tomb and tomb of the Malisan Tumulus Cluster, which was excavated and researched by the National Gaya Cultural Research Institute, made it easier for visitors to understand the structure of the tomb.

   The exhibition room is surprisingly small. In the exhibition hall on the 1st floor, a special exhibition of “Malyisan” artifacts is held until the 31st of December, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the opening of the Haman Museum. This is a valuable opportunity to learn more about the history and culture of Mt. Isan, including 100 relics excavated from Mt. What catches the eye is the unique patterns and shapes of pottery and various ornaments. The various shapes of plate legs show the characteristics of the Gaya pottery.

   The permanent exhibition hall on the 2nd floor exhibits various artifacts from the prehistoric times of the Haman region. In particular, artifacts related to the ancient Aragaya form the center. Exhibition Hall 3 is a place where you can increase your understanding of the Malisan Tumulus Cluster. It is a great harvest to learn about Aragaya, whose name is unfamiliar through the remains of Aragaya, who worked in the Haman area, and horse armor, round-ringed knives, fireballs, flame-patterned earthenware, and cartwheels excavated from Horse Mountain. . Flame-patterned earthenware is the representative earthenware of Aragaya and is also called flame-type earthenware. The flame pattern represents the symbolic nature of fire, meaning life, divinity, and purification.

   Horse armor, unearthed in the 1992 armor, is a relic of Aragaya's excellent iron skills. It is the first horse armor unearthed in a complete form in Korea. It is estimated that 440 ~ 453 pieces of different shapes were connected to make them 226-230 cm long and 43-48 cm wide. The size of the piece varies depending on the area to be protected, and the hole through which the string is sewn to connect the armor is also very fine, so you can get a glimpse of Aragaya's excellent technique.

   Aragaya was a country in the ancient Haman region. Due to its geopolitical location facing the sea to the south, it had frequent traffic to and from Japan with Geumguan Gaya from an early age. The Malisan Tumulus Cluster is a valuable relic telling how powerful the national tax of Aragaya was.

   In 1940, during the Japanese colonial period, it was divided into Dohang-ri and Malsan-ri subdivisions by dividing them into Dohang-ri and Malsan-ri, which span the same mountainous border. In 1963, the Korean government switched privately, but following the concept of Japanese imperialism, in 2011, the two tombs were united into one, taking into account the history and characteristics, and renamed it as 'Maisan Tombs'.
