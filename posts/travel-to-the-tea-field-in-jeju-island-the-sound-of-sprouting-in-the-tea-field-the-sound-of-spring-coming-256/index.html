    The spring of Jeju Island is always on the tea field. The tender tea leaves that bloom through the dark green tea leaves and bloom freshly give the warm spring energy along with rapeseed, camellia, plum, and narcissus. Dosun Dawon, Hannam Tea Garden, Seogwang Tea Garden, Seogwi Tea Garden, and Jeju Tea Garden, which are distributed in the middle mountainous and coastal areas south of Halla Mountain, are some of the best places to visit this spring. Walking through the path through the tea fields and welcoming the warmth of the southern country, the refreshing energy heals and purifies the tired body and mind. During a tea field trip, it is a good idea to take a walk in the attitude of a traveler who is engaged in meditation in consideration of the residents and other travelers who farm there.

   Dosun Tea Garden, a quiet tea garden that is good for landscape photography
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Dosun Tea Garden (152-41, Jungsan Ganseo-ro 356beon-gil, Seogwipo-si) is a tea garden operated by Jangwon, a subsidiary of AMOREPACIFIC, along with Seogwang Tea Garden and Hannam Tea Garden. The scale reaches 26,400 square meters. Seogwang Tea Garden, where the Osulloc Tea Museum is located, is always crowded with travelers. Not only Koreans, but also foreign tourists, such as Chinese, come to visit. On the other hand, Dosun Tea Garden is very secluded because only tourists who like to tour the tea fields or who are interested in taking landscape photos are visited.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   It is not easy to find the entrance because it quietly hides between the middle mountain road and the second mountain road in the northern part of Seogwipo City. The second point of pilgrimage with the signboard of 'Jeju Dosoon-ri camphor tree native' is the point of visiting Doseon Tea Garden. After 5 minutes north along the village road next to Gangjeongcheon, you will see a sign indicating that the tea field is hiding there. ‘Jangwon Seolok Dawon Dosoon’. After passing through a farming path where camellia and cypress trees grow together and crossing the dry water of Gungsancheon, the view of Dosun Tea Garden, which was finally seen only with pictures, unfolds before your eyes.

   There are many lanes that are good for walking around the 1km-long farm road that runs through the tea fields to the north and south. When you look up at Mt. Halla and raise your head, the questionnaire will blow white hair in the wind, and when you turn around and look at the sea of Seogwipo, the spring breeze over the Pacific Ocean will bounce off the waves with your last strength. Is this the topographic map of Pungsu? Since spring is the first place in the Korean Peninsula to visit Jeju Island, the news of tea leaf harvest is also heard at Dosoon Tea Garden.

   The virgin bachelors in Jeju Island visit each of these tea fields instead of famous tourist spots where “landland things” come together, and share the push of love when spring wind comes into their hearts. Red camellia flowers also glisten in the spring sunshine and celebrate youth. Even a graveyard lying on a stone wall in the middle of a tea garden leaves a strong body in the spring sunlight, and an adult haze burns. There is no admission fee for Dosun Tea Garden.

   Hannam Tea Garden, a tea garden stretching toward Hallasan and the blue sea
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Looking at the Donnaeko Tourist Center in Seogwipo City, if there is a Dosun Tea Garden in the west, Hannam Tea Garden (209, Seoseong-ro 652beon-gil, Seogwipo-si) is located in the east. It is close to Hannam Intersection on the 2nd Mountain Road and Jeju Citrus Complex Processing Plant. The entrance to the tea garden is easier to find than the Dosun tea garden because it does not hide in the forest path and touches the asphalt roadside.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The scale is about 46,2,800㎡, which is larger than Dosoon Tea Garden and smaller than Seogwang Tea Garden. Of course, like the tea garden of Jeju, Hallasan and Seogwipo seas evenly come into view. It is a tea field that belongs to the flat land rather than the Dosun Tea Garden. Hannam Tea Garden extends vigorously toward the summit of Hallasan Mountain and the blue sea of Seogwipo. The shiny leaves look like the scales of a dragon armed with green armor. The spiritual energy of Duomoak and Iedo fills the whole body. The vitality of the tea leaves, which attempt to soar through the stuffy earth and soar into the air, strongly stimulates the peripheral nerves. The joy of walking is just a bonus.

   Next to the long tea garden furrows, a fan standing between the telephone poles rides in the spring breeze of Jeju and goes back and forth. The fan, which looks like a fan's wings, is an artificial facility installed in order to prevent the damage of the tea tree, Yeon-sae, from frost. An official who met at the plantation said, “Even if the air on the surface of the earth is 0 degrees Celsius at night, there is an air layer of 3 to 6 degrees Celsius at 6 to 10 meters above the ground. On the day when the temperature goes down, turn on the fan to send the warm air from the upper floor to the tea tree. That way, we protect Saesoon. ”
   <br/>
   Solving a Chinese character called ‘cha (茶)’ means ‘grass and trees close to people’. For those who care for tea trees, they have no choice but to cultivate carelessly like children. As I walk around the wide tea garden in Hannam Tea Garden, I miss a cup of hot tea. It is also wise to fill in a tumbler with green tea before visiting the tea garden in case. There is no separate admission fee here.

   Drama and CF's regular stage, Seokwang Tea Garden
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   If you want to go to a tea field where you can enjoy walking, shopping, and experiencing at the same time, rather than a quiet atmosphere, I recommend Seogwang Tea Garden (446, Shinhwa History Road, Andeok-myeon, Seogwipo-si). Seogwang Tea Garden is the place where a entrepreneur's noble dream is contained. Sung-Hwan Ko, the founder of Amorepacific, is the main character. Regrettable that the tea culture of Korea, represented by Chusa Kim Jeong-hee and Choui-seonsa, is dying out, Chairman Seo revealed that Jeju Island is a suitable place for cultivating tea trees. Dawon, which was created for the revival of tea culture, has emerged as one of the best landscape agricultural spots in Jeju Island, so it is an excellent foresight.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The Seogwang Tea Garden is large in size and is set against Halla Mountain, large and small ascents, the horizon, and a lonely tree, so it appears well as a backdrop for dramas, movies, and CFs. Walking along the road through the tea fields is a very attractive destination because anyone can become a drama hero. Free admission.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Seogwi Dawon (717, 516-ro, Seogwipo-si) is worth visiting as a small privately operated tea garden. It is close to Donnaeko Tourist Site and is 66,000 square meters. Cedar Garosu-gil, leafy camellia, basalt sculpture, and tea gardens combine to show the original image of Jeju tea garden. This place has been operating as a citrus plantation for over 30 years, but Huang Sang-jong and An Haeng-ja changed to a tea garden in 2005 with their daughter Huh Sun-young, who wants to live in the taste and aroma of nature in “The World of Tea,” not just farming. Green tea tasting is possible when the owner is in or out of Dawon. Free admission.

   On the other hand, the green tea theme park (aka Green Tea Maze Park) operated by Jeju Tea Garden (1258, Sanroknam-ro, Seogwipo-si) is also regrettable if it is left out of Jeju's tea garden. Jeju Tea Garden, located near Lake Hills Golf Course along the 2nd mountain road, is unique in operating a green tea theme park. The theme park has trails such as the Olle-gil course (30 minutes required), the Sight-gil course (1 hour required), and the Dulle-gil course (1 hour 30 minutes required).
