    Uiyeong-gil in Bukhansan is a good way for the whole family to walk together. It is a mountain path, but the road is wide so you can walk with your shoulders. There are no steep or steep sections, so children walk well. In the autumn and solstice, the scent of the forest scents, and when you walk on Uyi-Ring, laughter blooms in your family's face.

   The area around the signboard of Ui-dong Food Village is untidy. Follow the road through the signboard, and there are many restaurants on both sides of the road. It's not a good place to walk. Especially on weekends, there are many cars that people who use restaurants can ride. This section is about 1.3 km long. Also, this section is an uphill road, so some people struggle from the beginning before walking in earnest.

If you go up this road about 500m, you will come to Bukhansan National Park Ui Tam Prevention Center. It is about 1.5km from here to Uyi-Ryeong Trail, which is easier than the road that has been walked up until now.

   Ui-Ryeong-gil is a path between the listed ridge line and Songchu Nam-nam line, connecting Jangheung-myeon, Yangju-si, Gyeonggi-do and Ui-dong, Gangbuk-gu, Seoul. It was a shortcut between Seoul and northern Gyeonggi. In the past, the wagon was a narrow road, and during the Korean War, the US Army Corps of Engineers paved the way for military operations. There is a monument to the opening of the operation road on the hillside of Uyiling.

   Departure from Uytam Prevention Center starts full-scale forest road. The road is made of Masato made from weathered granite. On the side of the road, you can see a short sign called ‘Uyi-Ring Forest that feels barefoot.’ But as I walked this road, I saw only one or two people walking barefoot. Because it is not a soft soil like ocher but rough soil, people who are not used to walking barefoot or have weak skin on their feet can wear shoes again even if they walk barefoot.

   Arrived at the Hui-Ring Trough. It is 1.5km from Wuyi Tam Prevention Center. The hillside remains an anti-tank obstacle, a military facility that drops a lump of concrete on the pedestal to the road to prevent enemy tanks from entering. From this place, it is going downhill to the Gyohyeon RDA. As you pass the antitank obstacles, you will see an observation deck overlooking Obong. One of the most beautiful landscapes you can see from Ouiyeong-gil is Obong.
