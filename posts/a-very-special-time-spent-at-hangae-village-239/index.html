    Seongju Hangae Village, with its 600 years of history, retains its old appearance, but is not as loud or busy as Hahoe Village and Yangdong Village. Among them, Jinsa's house is the only place where you can experience a mansion in the village, and you can taste a well-being country table. Jinsa's house is the best place to spend a quiet time in Hangae Village.

   The only place where you can experience the old house in Hangae Village, Jinsa

  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    The most beautiful and full of emotion in Hangae Village is the Jinsa House, the first place in town. There is no place where there is a wide front yard and a flower bed where fine flowers bloom and fall, and well and Jangdokdae. Personally, the factor that gauges the beauty of the old house is 'is there a person currently living?' Nature gradually breaks down when a person's hand touches or an artificial element is added, but the house maintains its appearance only when it touches a person's hand and warmth. The reason that Jinsa's house is beautiful is because it is a space where people live. The daughter of Kyung-min Lee is staying with her old couple in the office.

    The history of Jinsa's house can be traced back to the Joseon Dynasty. From Anchae's Sangnyangmun Gate, it is assumed that the house was built during the reign of King Jeongjo or Cheoljong. It was called after the house of Jinsa. When Lee Kuk-hee bought a house and lived in it, he passed the last lesson of the Joseon Dynasty in 1894, and was named Jinsa's house.

    The house of Jinsa consists of Anchae, Sarangchae, and Saesarang. Anchae is a tiled house, and Sarangchae and Bird Sarangchae are thatched houses. On the left side of the main building, a new Sarangchae in the shape of an 'A' stands, and in the future, three Sarangchaes overlook the wide courtyard. In front of Anchae, there are Jangdokdae, wells, and large flower beds, where various pots of various sizes are gathered together. Among the old houses, one thing to notice is the new love. Sae Sarangchae was the last building in Jinsa's house. It is unusual to place a new Sarangchae between Anchae, the female space and Sarangchae, the male space, but the floor, room, and warehouse each have 3 squares, each with 1 square, and the floor with a floor railing. It is unusual. Particularly, the '卍' shape was nicely displayed on the bulging windows on both sides of the entrance to the room.

    Jinsa's house is the only place where you can experience the old house among the numerous houses in Hangae Village. The old house experience is available in Sarangchae and Saerangchae. Sae Sarangchae is a small one-room room that can be used by two people, but it seems to have a separate space for free. Sarangchae consists of 2 rooms and Daecheong, and there is a spacious front yard, so it is good to stay in a family unit. As for the accommodation fee, the new Sarangchae is 50,000 won per day and the Sarangchae is 80,000 won per day. At Jinsa's house, you can enjoy a well-being country table made with soy sauce and hand-grown vegetables. If you pass the elaborate table prepared by the mother and daughter of the Jinsa's house, it seems to be regrettable.

   Jinsa's special winter, Meju landscape

  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Jinsa's house is very busy making meju every winter. Even this winter, the beans were boiled to make meju, and 13 bales of beans from Cheongdo, Gyeongbuk were used. It was around the time when the beans were almost boiled that I started to see the scenery of Meju. The heat of the burning fire slowly faded away, and the seaweed steamed from the beans boiled for 5-6 hours in a cauldron. It picks up a handful of beans that have been boiled for a taste, and the aroma is amazing.

   The same is true for making meju at Jinsa's house. There are many variables in making meju, such as the quality of the beans, the time to boil the beans, and the intensity of the fire. The taste differs depending on where the beans are grown, and the success and failure of Meju depends on the time and time of cooking the beans. This is why the way of making meju varies from house to house.

   When you put the boiled beans in a colander, the work of making meju begins in earnest. The process of making meju is largely similar. Grind the beans in a mortar, put them in a saucer and chop them with your feet to make a shape. At this time, it is important to scoop soybeans to a certain extent.

   Meju, which came out of the frame, is decorated with rice straw. This is the most important task when making meju. Rice straw provides the microorganisms necessary for fermentation of meju. The condition varies greatly depending on which microorganisms live in the rice straw, and it is generally said that white or yellow mold is better than blue or black mold. Despite the age of eighty-six, the tips of the woven weaves of rice straw are still delicate. I can feel the rich experience of making meju for over 50 years.

   Hangae Village with 600 years of history
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    One is a pure Korean word meaning large stream or large naru. Hangae Village has the position of a typical Baesan Forest geographically. Looking at the topography, Yeongchwisan Mountain is located at the back of the village, and to the left and right, the foot of Yeongchwisan Mountain, called Baekho Lantern and Blue Dragon Lantern, descends as if it surrounds the village. Across the village, a white stream merges with Icheon. Baekcheon was originally said to have been wide and deep enough to carry salt boats. When you look at the Baekcheon Embankment, you can see at a glance the village of Hangae, which is surrounded by Yeongchwisan Mountain.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Hangae Village is Seongsan Lee's Gipseongchon, where Iwoo, who used to be a pastor of Jinju during King Sejong in Joseon, is an incense. The entire village is an important folk cultural property No. 255, and it is a village with a long history and tradition that most of the old houses have been designated as cultural heritage.

    After passing through Jinsa's house, you can tour Wolgok's house, Bukbi's house, Gyori's house, Hanju's house, Dodong's house, Pokwa's house, and Hahoe's house. The place with the most stories in Hangae Village is Bukbi Old House. The owner of Bukbi House is Don Jae-seok, a former escort officer of the apostle during the Joseon Dynasty. When the apostle saint faced the humility of being imprisoned in the back lord under the command of Yeongjo, he suffered the injustice, but he went down to the village of Hangae, where he was stripped down, cut down the wall of Sarangchae, built a gate to the north, commemorated the apostle, and bowed down to the north. It is said that. Later, when King Jeongjo succeeded to the throne, and the descendants of Lee Seok-moon gave a manor-level system, he said, "Is there still a door in the north of your house?" As soon as you enter the gate of Bukbi Old House, the 'Bukbi' signboard is hung on the right. The gate to the north still wants the north as it was.
