   Cheongpodae Caravan Village's most prominent feature is its 'large'. A total of eight caravans are big at a glance. "Others are for 4-6 people, but we operate for couples." The owner's explanation. Smart! Try to get inside. 'Isn't it a caravan?' The prominent courtesy misses nicely. In addition to the double-bed queen size bedroom, the kitchen, living room and bathroom have a shower booth. Eight caravan interiors also vary. The caravan is an experience product, so the differentiation strategy is to have a different feeling every time it comes.
