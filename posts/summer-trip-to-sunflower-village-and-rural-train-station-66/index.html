   Many people are worried about where to go with their families on this summer's vacation. It is a good place for those who are looking for a place where they want to spend their time quietly rather than a place where a lot of people gather. It is the sunflower village of Yangpyeong-gun and Seokbul Station and Gudun Station, which are rural railway stations. Don't forget to take a camera with you to leave your family in a wonderful photo.

   Sunflower Village, Seokbul Station and Gudun Station are located on Jipyeong-myeon, Yangpyeong-gun. This area is famous for Jipyeong Makgeolli. You can get there by train, so you don't have to waste time during a busy holiday season. Not a lot of people come to visit, but it is perfect for a day trip quietly. If you set the date well, you can also enjoy the Yongmun oil market.

   If you take a bus from the Yongmun Intercity Bus Terminal near Yongmun Station, you can get off at the bus stop where the large signpost written 'Muwang 1-ri' stands. 初 川 (chocheon) used together on the stone is the old name of the sunflower village. The water flowing through the Yeoju into the Namhan River began in the sunflower village and was called as follows. Pass through the stone and meet the typical rural village landscape. Sunflowers on the road seem to give the name of the village. The village boasts a peaceful landscape in the form of a basin at 300m above sea level.

   The sunflowers that bloomed here were planted in late May and began to bloom in late July. In 2014, with the support of the Gyeonggi-do Agricultural Technology Center, sunflower seeds were planted for the income of the villagers. After the sunflower bloomed, the scenery began to spread. In the summer, photo club members often come to town to capture the flowers that fill the fields. Note that there are no restaurants or stalls in town.

In the villages, sunflower fields are not fixed, but they are planted using land, so you can find flowers everywhere. Sunflowers are also slightly bloomed, so you can go to flower viewing as if you are looking for a hidden picture.

   In the middle of the road, the voices of those who look at the sunflowers and admire the beautifulness are often heard. There are many visitors who take commemorative photos standing side by side with sunflowers. Sunflowers are too tall or they turn their heads in the wrong direction, making them hard to see. It is also common here for children to marvel at the bees rushing toward a full-blown seed sunflower.

   If you want to know where sunflowers are spread throughout the village, you can refer to the guide map of `` Muwangri Sunflower Road '' installed on the crossroads before going to the town hall. In the parking lot, you can see a lot of sunflowers on the hill road, near the town hall, and on the way to the Muwang Church.

   The village also held its 3rd Sunflower Festival 2016 (July 29-31). This is a village festival prepared for the flowering period of sunflowers. During the festival, visitors sold sunflower barley rice, yeolmu noodles, and pan-fried rice to visitors. There was also a marketplace selling sunflower seeds, barley, corn, potatoes, and bokbunja grown in the village. Sunflowers are expected to open until the end of August. The festival is over, but it's a good place to go to see flowers with your family.

   Seokbul Station is like a toy country

  <div class="txt_p">
   A simple station is a train station with few passengers. There is a station station where employees are in charge of their duties, but stop only trains without even having to. Thanks to the unique atmosphere and dignity, many people deliberately come to the station to feel romantic and memories.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   There is a working room but no staff. To take the train towards Cheongnyangni, cross the underground passage to the right of the entrance. The distance from Sunflower Village to Seokbul Station is less than 3 km. If you drive by car, it's easy to get there, but it's not convenient to use public transportation.

   Originally, Seokbul Station was destined to disappear due to fewer customers. It was unfortunate that the county and the county government jointly signed a campaign to prevent the removal of the Seokbul Station and built a new building in 2013. Thanks to this, there is no atmosphere of an old building that is expected of a simple station, but rather a small and small station building.

   The pointed red roof of Seokbul Station and the outer wall of a blue building are easy to see from afar. Thanks to this, if you travel by bus or car from Yongmun or Muwang-ri, you can see the beautiful blue building in the distance. Standing in front of Seokbul Station building, it feels like a visit to Toy Land. The exterior walls and windows are a great backdrop for taking pictures. It's like a sketchbook with pastel colored walls.

Gudun Station is also famous as the filming location of the film Introduction to Architecture. Like the heroes in the movie, many people walk along the railway and leave memories on the camera.

   Inside the station, there are long wooden chairs, train schedules and passenger fares. If you go out to the railroad tracks, you will see a wish tree with a memo of the people who visited this place. What did you write down? I peek at the short texts of strangers and write down my wishes and hang them by my side. Next to the tree stands a carriage that is not running. Take a walk with the whole family on a railroad train. About 100 meters of railroad tracks remain from the station building. The well-preserved closed area and the surrounding landscape are beautiful and it is a good place to spend some time.
