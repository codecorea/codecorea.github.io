   Cheorwon-gun hosts the Hantan River Ice Trekking Festival every mid-January. This year, the seventh year, the festival is held for nine days from January 19 to 27. It's the only ice trek theme in Korea that walks on frozen rivers.

   The Hantan River Trail runs from the Taebong Bridge, which is the starting point, to the Goseokjeong which is the destination, and most of the sections overlap the ice trekking course. That's because the road was designed to compensate for the lack of ice trekking. In other words, even the coldest weather in Cheorwon is not enough to freeze the entire Hantan River, which is famous for its roughness, so that people can walk on it. Therefore, the Hantan River Trail is designed to make it possible to bypass only high velocity or deep water sections.

   The Hantan River Trail begins at Taebong Bridge, just like ice trekking. After walking down a short staircase, you will pass through a small park with rest facilities such as toilets and wooden chairs. Hanging close enough to smell the fresh water, the Hantan River sparkles in jade as if it were against the seasons. Even after descending to the river, the trail is clear. There is no rough surface because it is not the original way, but the sandbags are stacked in the chin to adjust the height, and the signal ribbons indicating the direction of progress are also tightly attached so that you can walk comfortably without getting lost.

   The bridge was installed where the river that flowed without hesitation took a breath. If the river was frozen, I would not have to cross it, but now I can't find the 'ㅇ' of ice. In fact, it was the biggest disappointment of the 6km Hantan River Trail. Why not? The famous Songdae place is a place where you can see the frontal view and bend around with a jujube joint spreading like Buchatsal. Songdaeso's columnar joint towering on the transparent ice floor is one of the representative images of the Hantan River, or Cheorwon's winter. Song Dae-so is deep enough to lack a bundle of yarn, so when ice trekking, do not approach the columnar joint, but only pass the designated course.

   After the pedestrian bridge, the road mixes with the two courses for a while. Climb the short slopes and pass the refreshing deck road to see the birch forest. It's not luxuriant, but it still feels like a surprise gift. Passing through the smooth shape of the birch forest, you will find the Songdae Observatory. The songdaeso, which was hidden in a tree and scattered like a puzzle piece, is completely united here.

   Missing the way here does not mean getting lost. However, if you miss the yellow ribbon with the words 'Hantan River Ice Trekking', you will follow the middle of the road. That means about 3.5 kilometers, or more than half, along the wrong road, from the bridge that meets the Songdaeso Observatory to the Seungil Bridge where the driving site is located. The road that descends to the riverside is about 100m ahead of the signpost in front of the bridge.
