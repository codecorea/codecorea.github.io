The festival is celebrated for the 2014 New Year's morning in Jeju, as nationwide are busy preparing for the event. Let's pledge a hopeful new year at Seongsan Ilchulbong, a world-famous attraction.

   Sunrise Festival for World Natural Heritage
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Seongsan Ilchulbong, one of the first fingers of Jeju Island, was created by volcanic activity in the sea about 5,000 years ago. It is called Seongsan because it looks like a huge castle, and it is named Seongsan Ilchulbong because the sunrise seen here is the best. Seongsan Ilchulbong is the first World Natural Heritage in Korea selected by UNESCO. Although it is usually visited by many tourists, the surrounding area is truly phosphated until late at night on December 31 of each year. People gather from all over the country to spend the last night of the year and watch the sunrise on the first morning of the new year.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The Seongsan Ilchul Festival, which marks the 21st anniversary of this year, is expected to be more colorful and rich than in the previous year. Prior to the festival, the World Natural Heritage Exploration Program will be held on December 30, and a cultural performance venue will be held in the afternoon such as bands, circus, and performing arts groups. In the meantime, various experience events such as kite making and traditional weddings are held.

    On December 31, the day of the festival, the entire area of Seongsan Ilchulbong is noisy. From local noon to a parade, performance, show, and fireworks, starting at noon, there is a lot to see and do. Even before the opening ceremony, programs that excite the festival continue to be held, such as cultural performances of local clubs and a parade of hope. The performance stage prepared by the locals by practicing hard is unpretentious, but it is more friendly and touching. Even the grandmothers dance with care and the little boys wearing ballet clothes and spinning around are enough to convey their emotions.

   Go go with the festival! Seopjikoji and Aqua Planet
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Seongsan Ilchulbong is a good place to visit around Seopjikoji and Aqua Planet. Both of them are within a 10-minute drive from Seongsan Ilchulbong, so it's good to tie them together with the festival.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Seopjikoji is a good place to walk slowly while watching the surrounding scenery. Rocky rocks rising up to the shore create spectacular views, and blue fields spread on the other side soak up the peaceful atmosphere. However, it is a place with a lot of wind, so it is better to fasten the collar. Pay special attention to the fact that the hat is blown away by the wind.

   Planning a trip to Udo on the first day of the new year is also a special memory. It takes 5 minutes by car from Seongsan Ilchulbong to Seongsan Port, and 15 minutes by boat to Udo. Udo, the largest of the islands in Jeju Island, can be toured around the island by bicycle, scooter, or tour bus. You can also walk along the Olle Trail signs created in Udo.

There are many main dishes that will delight your mouth, such as ice cream made from peanuts, which is a specialty of Udo, taiyaki, and hotteok. Hadosu-dong and Seobinbaeksa, the famous beaches in Udo, are also places to visit. The bright white sand beach and the brilliant blue sea landscape make everyone fall in love at first sight. There are many lodgings like guest houses, guest houses, and pensions in Udo, so it's good to stay overnight.
