   It is said that the season of reading is autumn. But think about it. There is no time to read a book other than futons. How about a break trip to prepare for a vibrant spring? So I prepared. It is a small bookstore hidden in the corner of a mountain, a small bookstore in the forest.

   A place where books are interesting, a small bookstore in the Miru Village Forest

  <div class="txt_p">
   Miru Village located in Goesan Mountain Mountain, Chungbuk Province. In that small town, there is a small bookstore that Alice seems to be living in. If you are a bookworm, the place you want to visit once, even those who are not interested in books, are obsessed with the desire to read books. There are books that the owner made handmade papers with the contents of the books, and the old picture books turn into envelopes for books, a small bookstore in the woods.

   This place, which is simply located in a family home, is also home to the wishes of a couple who operated a small children's library in Ilsan and Mapo. The first desire to build a library in a rural village and make it a place full of books and culture was paused for a number of difficulties, but instead brought their dreams into their homes without giving up.

   This place is different from the entrance. When you push a small fence and step on one foot, your nose is creaky, so you can see the lush appearance of the book to the hut where a long Pinocchio greets, a hammock that you want to grab and grab a book in your hand, and a deck where you can taste the taste with your eyes. Also becomes a lucky person who has already found a treasure trove.

   A small bookstore in the woods is a lovely day for just a visit, but there is a way to feel 120%. Attic, a hidden dream space in a small bookstore in the woods. On the second floor, there is an unexpected pleasure that you can't think of overnight.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   When the darkness falls and the bookstore's door closes, this place is completely my home. He stays on the second floor of the house where the owner stays and uses the bathroom and toilet together with the owner. As the sound of turning a book in silence keeps turning one, two, and more, the books I have read are piled up. The story that follows the consensus of a book with a drink or refreshment is more interesting and fresh than a book.

   This is not the only preference allowed in one night in the attic. If you open a bookshelf that is likely to come out of the Hogwarts School of Magic, open the hidden treasure chest. In the name of Alice's Attic. This is the name given to the idea that “Alice in Wonderland” is a strange place, like a strange country that I fell into a rabbit hole. In this room, more than 500 pop-up books, art books, and character dolls collected from all over the world are waiting for their hands to spend the night together.
