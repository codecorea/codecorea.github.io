    It is a good time to walk. Wherever you want to walk, the place I chose today is the Sea of Japan Sea Route. Among them, we walk on the sunrise road of Donghae City, where the magnificent seascape and charming sights are combined. The coastal road (ilchulro) hidden inside National Highway 7 passes through Mukho Port, Eodal Port, and Daejin Port. Mukho Lighthouse, Nongoldamgil, Kamakbawi, and many other attractions, simple and small houses and shops are in harmony. When you pass by car, you can see the scenes that you may have missed.

    The route from Mukho Port to Daejin Port or Mangsang Beach belongs to Haeparanggil 34 course. Haeparang-gil is an east coast trail that runs from Busan in the south to Goseong in Gangwon-do in the north. 34 of them depart from Mukho Station in Donghae City and pass through Mukho Lighthouse, Eodal Port, Daejin Port, Mangsang Beach, and Simgok Yakcheon Village to Okgye Market in Gangneung City.

   Feel the whole body of the sea with the fishy smell of fresh seafood caught at Mukho Port. Pick your favorite seafood from the fish market and take it to a nearby restaurant for cooking. There are also many restaurants, such as Gomchikuk and grilled fish. After filling the boat, we begin our walking tour in earnest.

It contains the stories of the people of the sea who lived around Mukho Port. Nongol 1-gil, 2-gil, 3-gil and Lighthouse-Oreum are central. Each alley has the theme of mukho's past, present, future, and mukho of all, and a mixture of time. It is more meaningful because it is a mural that contains stories about the past and present in the neighborhood. As you climb the Nongoldamgil, you will reach Mukho Lighthouse.

   The heavy white circular Mukho Lighthouse is located in the middle of the mountain at an altitude of 67m, and is easily seen from Mukho Port, and the sea view from here is also cool. The Mukho Lighthouse, founded in June 1963, was the main filming location for the movie &lt;Hate Once Again&gt;, and in 2003 a monument to the "Hometown of Movies" was erected. Mukho Lighthouse also appears in the films &lt;Mary Story&gt; and &lt;Blue Alert&gt;. The lighthouse is 12m high and can be seen from inside. As you climb the spiral staircase, you will see a lighthouse observation deck, and you can see the scenery from all sides.
