  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Among the children's forest experience centers in Seoul, the program is being actively conducted in Geumcheon-gu's grasshopper. Most of the other places just use space without specialized programs. In addition, the name of the park or mountain was used as the name, but Geumcheon-gu made the name of the infant forest using ‘Bestang’, a pronoun of insects that play with fun. Groups can be booked in kindergartens or daycare centers on weekdays, and on Saturday mornings, individual families can participate in the program. Of course, if you find it on a weekday, you can play at the forest experience place without reservation. Although the contents of the program vary depending on the season, it is common to observe trees, insects, and grass at the Gamrocheon Ecological Park attached to the side, and return to the experience center to finish with various games.

   Various experiences are prepared according to the characteristics of the season. In the fall, pine cones and pine cones that fall on the forest road are picked up for viewing, and red ripe cornel berries and hawthorn berries are also tasted. It is easy for children to understand that the plant spreads seeds in a variety of ways, such as feeding on birds and animals with delicious fruits or flying like a leaf and flying in the wind.

   Acorns and chestnuts feed small animals such as squirrels and blue-eyed squirrels, but children seem to cry suddenly when they are told that adults can scarcely feed them. At that time, a young snow cap appears and rides the tree. The children are fascinated and look at them as they move around the branches quickly.
