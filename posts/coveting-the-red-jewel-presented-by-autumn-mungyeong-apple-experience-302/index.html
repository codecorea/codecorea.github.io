   The apple field I found in October is blue and red. The sky is absolutely blue, and the apples are more red than any autumn leaves. Apple picking is available until the end of October. The busiest varieties, Busa, are harvested in November, but once cooked, they must be picked up and stored in a low-temperature warehouse.

   Papa's Farm, one of the farmhouses experiencing the Mungyeong Apple Festival, is less than 5 minutes from Gaeun-eup. After inheriting the orchards of his parents, who had been growing apples for a long time, his son, Kim Jong-ha, became the farmer. Like a young farmer, the sales floor on the side of the road is clean, and it is pioneering sales channels through direct transactions over the Internet.

   When I step into the apple garden, it feels dazzling and thick. This is because of the reflector on the floor. Since apples ripen red and sugar content rises only after receiving the light, the film that reflects light is spread widely on the floor. That's why all apples are red evenly, regardless of where they are running.

   When picking apples, be careful not to damage the branches. If you grab the apple and flip it up, it will bounce and fall off easily. There are so many open places that children can enjoy harvesting themselves without the help of their parents.

   Apples are good for your health, as there is a saying that 'one apple a day does not require a doctor.' It is effective in preventing skin diseases and aging, as well as preventing adult diseases and heart disease. Many people worry about residual pesticides and cut them, but if you wash them well, don't worry. The apple peel has a lot of dietary fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants that are good for constipation, so you should eat it.
