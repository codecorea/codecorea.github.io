   In fact, the Durkuk branch has always been in crisis due to the small number of students a few years ago. Then, in 2012, it was selected as Samsung's 'HD Super AMOLED Color Project' and changed to the same shape now. At the time, the project was led by world-renowned colorist Jean-Philip Lanclaw, the founder of 'Color Geography', and thanks to him, Durkuk School was reborn as an unprecedented fairy tale colorful school. Not only children but also teachers were set up in beautifully refurbished schools, and more and more students were transferred to school. The interesting thing is that it is not only the students who have increased. As the school became famous, customers who had never thought of 'travelers' began to come.

    When I first meet with the school, most of them ask, "Here is school?" It is because of the unfamiliar scenery that is quite far from the image of the school we think. The school's colorfully colored playgrounds and low-rise buildings are like three-dimensional sculptures just popping out of a fairy tale book. When I see children playing in a fairy-tale school under a blue sky, I even wonder if I'm shooting a movie somewhere.

   Even the small bell hanging from the cherry tree in front of the main building is so cute and pretty. It is not a decorative accessory, but a real 'school bell'. The teacher's office door opens, and the teacher comes out and rings the bell lightly. The sound of 'tinting' that spreads out clearly and finely. The children who were playing screamed into the classroom, and soon a fine chorus sounded out. At a peaceful time, we take full advantage of healing energy at school.

    The second floor consists of a gallery building. There are many interesting exhibits featuring Hello Kitty. The kitty room, decorated like a princess room, seems to contain the romance of women. "Kitty is good", the elasticity mixed with envy flows from place to place. On the 3rd floor, you can see three-dimensional images of Hello Kitty's adventures. Immerse yourself in the real world for less than 10 minutes. After spending a relaxing time drinking coffee on the Hello Kitty-drawn cake, stop by the souvenir shop on the way out to get a gift. The day is passing by as I fall in love with the pink fairy tale world that is nowhere to be found.
