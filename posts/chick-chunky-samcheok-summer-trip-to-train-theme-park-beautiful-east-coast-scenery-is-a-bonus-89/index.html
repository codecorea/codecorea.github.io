   The Swiss mountain train Incline train is the first thing that catches your eye. It is the only Swiss-style mountain train in Korea that rebuilds the railway that was demolished in 1963 and climbs up and down an altitude of 200m and over 15 degrees. Steel Railroad is a railway made in 1993 to overcome the altitude difference between Samcheok Symphony and Taebaek Tongli. The 15.6-degree sloping track made of the altitude difference pulled up the train. To put it simply, think of a steep uphill train. People walked around.

   Rail Coaster. It's a common rail bike we go down the hill at 25km per hour. Unlike other rail bikes, the rail coaster runs down the 12 tunnels, so you only need to pedal for the first few minutes and the brakes are good for the rest. Although rattling, it's a relatively comfortable rail bike with legs and mind. In addition to the switchback, reservations must be made for popular trains at High One Chuchu Park.
