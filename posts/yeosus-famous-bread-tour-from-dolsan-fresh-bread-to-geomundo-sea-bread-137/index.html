   The place I visited to taste unique bread is the Yeosu Fresh Baked Bakery. Bakery is located near Dolsan Bridge, near Bongsan Crab Street. When you enter the bakery, you will see three different bakery profiles with different kinds of bread. Since it is a bakery in the Republic of Korea, the belief in taste goes first.

  <div class="txt_p">
   There are a variety of breads, but the first thing that catches your attention is Dolsangat Odong Bread and Kappa. Odong bread has various modifiers such as 'unique world', 'patent technology' and 'development of sediment.'

   Geomundo Grand Piape with bread full of sea wormwood flavor

   This time it's time to taste the bread made with sea wormwood. Geomundo Haepoong Mugwort is famous for being a healthy eco-friendly wormwood grown in the face of sea breeze and seaweed. In recognition of its geographical characteristics, it was designated as a geographically registered registered agricultural product. If you go to the Grand Piaf at the roundabout in Yeosu-dong, Yeosu, you can find delicious bread made with sea wormwood. It is filled with specialty bread made by a baker who is from Japan's East Economics Academy and has over 20 years of experience.

   While eye-catching bread is full, first look for bread with Geomungdo sea wormwood. Geomun also has pancakes made with sea wormwood, red bean bread and castella. The wormwood is not strong in general and can be enjoyed by everyone. Sea wormwood pancakes are made with the traditional Japanese style of Dorayaki. On the outside of the bread is the word 'Geommoondo Haepoong mugwort'. The bread is green with mugwort, and inside is a cow mixed with red beans and cream.

Haipung mugwort pancakes cost 1,200 won and sweet red bean paste 1,500 won each.

   Let's go to Yi Sun Shin Square, which was built in the old port of Yeosu. The cool sea and the 2nd Dolsan Bridge can be seen at a glance. It is a good place to take a walk and relax while facing the sea breeze. There is a turtle ship at Yi Sun Shin Square, and there is a turtle turtle shop near Yeosu specialty bread. It sells bread made in the shape of a turtle ship in harmony with Yi Sun Shin Square. It wasn't long before, but it was already word of mouth among travelers.

   On the other hand, yuzu bread has a completely different shape and taste from turtle sun bread. It is fresh with yellow and round shape.

Because they sell only a fixed amount a day, they are often sold out in the morning on weekends and vacations. It is open at 9am on weekdays and 8:30 am on weekends. Turtle bread is not available individually, and a box of five is 9,000 won.

   Rustic bread that brings memories, single bungle bakery
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Single Bungle Bakery is a simple neighborhood bakery where you can taste the old bread of memories. It is such a bakery that I saw in front of school. In fact, Yeoju Joongang Elementary School, Yeosu Girls 'Middle School, and Yeosu Girls' High School are gathered near Single Bungle Bakery. There are only six kinds of bread. They sell salad bread, croquettes, red bean donuts, sausage bread, cream bread and steamed bread. Salad bread with cabbage and pink sausage mixed with mayonnaise is a nostalgia for its shape and taste. Bread costs 800 won each. It is not expensive because it is aimed at students. The store has more than 20 years of history, and it's only 600 won higher than it used to be. Compared to the fort inflation rate, it is a slow climb.

Travelers can also be guided in detail on the Yeosu travel course. This is the information we hear from locals who have love for Yeosu. The reason why travelers come to this small bakery in the corner is not just the taste of bread, but the special atmosphere where you can feel the memories and affection.
