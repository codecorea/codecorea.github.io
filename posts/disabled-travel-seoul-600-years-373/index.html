   Complex cultural space where time crosses, Cultural Station Seoul 284
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   At one time, the symbol of Seoul was Seoul Station. It is a story of the old history, where Western arches stood out in the magnificent dome. Cultural Station Seoul 284 refers to a complex cultural space that restored the old history that had been neglected after giving its role to the new Seoul Station in 2011. '284' is the historical number of Seoul Station, where various cultural events are held centering on exhibitions. Most of them are free so anyone can enjoy them.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   What makes Seoul Station 284 unique is that the past and the present intersect intermittently. It seems that the exhibition event prepared in 2017 was exhibited in the space of 1925. This is because the space was remodeled to make the most of the space. A particularly noticeable space is the VIP waiting room on the second floor. Western fireplaces and colorful chandeliers remain, giving a glimpse into the time.

   If you have enough time, you can also visit Changgyeonggung Palace, which is about 1.12 km from Jongmyo Shrine, and Changdeokgung Palace. Although these two palaces were originally located in the area of Jongmyo, they were separated by the Chosun Governor during the Japanese occupation. Changgyeonggung Palace is relatively quiet compared to other palaces, making Changdeokgung Palace a beautiful supporter, and it is easy to fall into the coziness of the forest.

  <div class="txt_p">
   From Jongmyo, Gwangjang Market is about 496m (walking). This is the first permanent market opened in Korea. It was opened in 1905, so it is 112 years ago. At the time of its establishment, the name was Dongdaemun Market, and since then it has been called Gwangjang Market since the 1960s. The scale is also large. More than 5,000 stores across Jongno 4-ga and Yeji-dong were located in a three-story market. The majority of stores handle fabrics and old products such as hanbok fabrics, suits, and dressmaking. This is why Gwangjang Market is also called a bailout or textile market.
