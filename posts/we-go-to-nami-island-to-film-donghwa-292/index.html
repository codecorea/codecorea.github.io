    When talking about Nami Island, there are some things that cannot be left out. Among them, the drama &lt;Winter Sonata&gt;, which created 'Jihime' and 'Yon-sama' in 2002, is typical. Although 10 years have passed, Nami Island, the location of their 'first kiss', is still loved as a 'holy place' for lovers. It would be a similar context for a lot of poisonous lovers to flock to Nami Island in the snowy winter. Even if you don't know the drama, once you see Nami Island in winter, you will use it as a date course without forgetting each time your lover changes (?).

   The name of 'Nami Island' is due to Nami General (1441 ~ 1468). At the age of seventeen, there was a stone grave here known as the tomb of General Nami, who died for sixty six years under the mothership of Yoo Ja-gwang. During the development of Nami Island, the tombs were trimmed to make the Nami General Gamyo.
