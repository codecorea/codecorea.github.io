   In spring, bright April, this time of year, the island gets wet with silent pain. This is because it has a sad history hidden behind a bright pile of flowers, and Jeju 4/3 incidents.

   I don't know if there are people who remember. It's an old old drama story. The drama &lt;The Eye of the Dawn&gt; that I watched while I was young. One of the scenes I still remember is the burning of thatched houses and soldiers dragging people randomly. At that time, I didn't know that it was Jeju Island. I didn't even know if the scene showed Jeju 4/3 event (Jeju 4/3).

  <div class="txt_p">
   Before I left the road, I remembered the moment. If there is something that has not changed as a child or now, I still do not know the history of Jeju 4/3. As the first course, I visited Jeju 4/3 Peace Park. Bonggae-dong hillside where Hallasan was cast like a shadow in the distance, and the Jeju 4/3 Peace Park is a space to remember the Jeju 4/3 and remember the victims. There are several facilities on the grounds, such as the 4.3 Peace Memorial Hall, the Memorial Hall, each monument, and the Wipeongbongso. On the 3rd of April every year, the “Jeju 4/3 victims' memorial service” is held here.

   When we entered the 4th and 3rd Peace Memorial Hall, Baekbi (a monument without inscription) met us silently. A pure stone monument with nothing written on it. In front of the lying Baekbi, there is a slab with the phrase, “One day, I will engrave the name of Jeju 4 · 3 and raise it up”. As I quietly woke up alone, I feel like one of my breasts is getting eaten.

   After passing by Baekbi, the story of Jeju Island, which has been in pain for many years, can be heard. Each exhibition hall divided into several themes describes in detail the background, cause, and process of Jeju 4/3. Many people who have died without knowing English because of the vortex of ideology after liberation, and the heartbreaking history that has been forced into silence for many years, are still alive and breathing here. Many people do not know yet, so the history is sadder. Jeju 4 · 3 is like a puzzle piece lost in modern Korean history.

   The exhibition hall arranged Jeju 4 and 3 events over the years from April 3, 1948 to 1954, which lifted the Hallasan Geumjoryeong Order in chronological order. Thanks to this, it is easy to understand even those who are new to Jeju 4 · 3 history. During this period, more than 30,000 Jeju Islanders were reportedly lost and missing. The exhibition tells the stories of the villages in the middle-mountainous area that have been burned down, and the people who have lost their lives have to hide into the mountains and caves.

   At the edge of the Altre Airfield in southwestern Jeju, there are six grains. It is the site of a crushing slaughter that has arrived for a long time as if you were driving in a wild field. It is a place where people arrested in the preliminary arrest during the Korean War were collectively executed. At that time, those who were randomly caught and dragged were said to have left traces of themselves by throwing rubber-like belongings on the roadside in a truck that seemed to foresee the coming death.

   It is said that many people in Seongsan-myeon were sacrificed during the Jeju 4/3 period. Now the son-in-law is still and peaceful as if it had happened. It seemed that he was struggling not to forget the memory of only the space comforting the souls becoming dull. If you stop by Gwangchigi Beach, take a moment of silence.

   About 20 minutes by car from Seongsan Ilchulbong is Darangsioreum, which many tourists visit. It is said that there was a village of Daranche, which originated more than 100 years under the ascension, but all burned down during Jeju 4/3, and now only lush bamboo forests have a glimpse of the trace.

   At the end of the road, which leads to a secluded trail on the road, there is the site of the Darangshgul. While running in dusty dust, the victims of Jeju 4/3 were found in the cave about a decade ago, and the news that caused shock and pain was dimly remembered. The Dalangshgul was a refuge for the residents of nearby Sehwa-ri and Jong-dal. The entrance to the oyster is now blocked.

   I recalled the inside of the cave seen from the Jeju 4 · 3 Peace Park Special Exhibition Hall. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't imagine the escape life in a narrow and steep cave. Their hearts are throbbing and crying just as they would have been desperate.
