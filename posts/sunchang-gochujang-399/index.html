   'Hwaryongjeomjeong (畵 龍 點 睛)' is an archaic word meaning 'to draw a dragon and then put a dot on the pupil'. It is derived from the testimony that a man named Jang Seung-yo, a painter of the Yang Dynasty of the South and North China era, painted four dragons on the wall of the euthanasia and could not overcome the torch of the people around him, drawing the pupils on the dragon and ascending the dragon in the picture.

   A spoonful of red hot pepper paste is put on the rice when you have lost your appetite in the heat or when you eat barley rice or savory sanchae bibimbap after returning home after a long trip abroad. At that moment, the word Hwaryongjeong comes to mind. Without this red pepper paste, barley rice or wild vegetable bibimbap would not be able to taste. Among the Paldo Gochujang, Sunchang Gochujang boasts a taste recognized by others.

    There are many types of red pepper paste, including glutinous red pepper paste, borigo pepper paste, and plum pepper paste. Here, a Korean side dish called Jang-A-Ji, which is filled with various vegetables and has a deep taste, was born. Garlic pickles, plum pickled pickles, melon pickled pickles, wool pickled pickled pickles, hedgehog pickled pickets, and persimmon pickled picks were more common. Vegetables put in miso were also various, such as soybean leaves, sesame leaves, cucumbers, garlic species, radish, bellflower, and red pepper. The number of days when I met pickles at the table was reduced due to the change of the years, and it is clear that the effect is still perfect for regaining the appetite that has run away even if I put one on the rice.

    Even if you go to Sunchang Traditional Gochujang Village, you can try these pickles even at any store. After dipping out the salty taste with a cup of Sikhye, mix the pickles to be put on the family table and buy them one by one.

   An official from the Soonchang Jangje Festival Promotion Committee explains the secrets of the taste of Sunchang Gochujang for various reasons. First of all, Sunchang is different from other regions in terms of pepper sauce. Most of the lunar octopus is picked up in October to make meju in winter, but in Soonchang, it is made separately for red pepper paste in front and rear (August to September). This is because the fungus that produces the sweet taste of the intestine reproduces as the temperature increases. Gochujang is immersed in the middle of the Lunar New Year and mid-New Year. Meju floats in the hot summer season, and hot pepper paste is soaked in cold winter to reduce sourness and enhance the umami taste through low temperature fermentation. Also, it is emphasized that it is not possible to ignore making red pepper paste meju as a soy sauce meju.

   The taste of sunchang using red pepper paste can be felt in pork bulgogi, which goes up to Korean traditional food. With more than 20 side dishes, Jeolla-do's reputation has been preserved. Because the place called Sunchang is a mountainous region, it is unique to pick up a lot of pickles or salted fish because it is difficult to supply seafood and other products on time. Even so, all the side dishes are foods that use Sunchang's red pepper paste, miso, and soy sauce.
