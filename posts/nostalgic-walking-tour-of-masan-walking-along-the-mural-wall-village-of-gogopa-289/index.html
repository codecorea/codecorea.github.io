    From autumn 2013 to winter, the city of Masan got attention again. It is because of the drama &lt;Response, 1994&gt; that sparked a big topic.

    The name Masansi has disappeared, but the charm of the space called Masan still remains. The historic town of Masan evokes memories and romance that cannot be felt in a shiny and refined new city. On a warm spring day, let's take a walk from Changdong, the largest bustling street in Masan, past Bulim Market and go to the mural village of Gagopa Koburanggil, which was built in Seongho-dong, Seongho-dong. The rich fragrance that the drama &lt;Response, 1994&gt; delivered gave rises like a haze on a spring day.

As such, Changdong was an important place in Masan. However, afterwards, the commercialization of the city led to a decline and the loneliness remained.

   From the 1950s to the 80s, Changdong Art Village is a street of culture and art that decorated Changdong, the center of commerce and culture and art, with three themes: Masan Art Trail Alley, Tattoo Art Alley, and Ecole Changdong Alley. Alongside the alleys, there are plenty of cute murals and installation art, and shops and workshops with perfect personality provide time for memories and romance. Don't miss the fun of eating, as the traditional deep-seated restaurants such as Changdong Bokhee House and Changdong Dessert, which were popular during the prosperous season, and Goryeodang and Koayangdae, both mountains of Masan Bakery, are all in this area.

   After the trip to the alley of Changdong Art Village, which continues like a maze, let's move on to Bulim Market, one of Masan's largest commercial districts along with Changdong in the 1980s. Also known as Gyeongnam's representative apparel wholesale market and Tteokbokki alley, Burim Market has also declined since the 1990s. As the number of empty shops increased, a creative crafts village was launched in late 2013 as part of the project to save the original downtown. Various themed workshops such as Korean paper, cloisonne, and ceramics move in to provide attractions and experiences.
