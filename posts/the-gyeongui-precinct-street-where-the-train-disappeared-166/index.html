   There is a way to enjoy a book while walking outside the stuffy interior. It refers to 'Gyeongui Seonseo Street', which is a book-themed theme around Hongik University Station, renowned for its music, art and youth. It's a good way to sit on a bench and read a book on the upcoming spring day. This is a road where you can enter the booth installed at the Gyeongui Precinct Street and enjoy the good luck of sharing your eyes with the artist you stumbled upon while reading a book. Let's go on a picnic in the early spring as a book street ..

   The start is exit 6 of Hongik University Station. If you come out of the basement and go back, you will see a sculpture written as Gyeongui Precinct Street. Starting from here, the road leading to the lower section of the Wo Wago Expressway is a respectable street.

  <div class="txt_p">
   On the road that leads to about 250m, there are bookstores and cultural spaces that display and sell books on various topics. Various events organized by bookstores are held at Gyeongui Seonseo Street. As you walk along the road, you can easily access works representing books and book information. There is a bicycle parking space next to the operation office, so anyone can use it. Toilets are available in the office building on the day of the event. On the other day, you should use the toilet at Hongik University Station.

   Gyeongui Line refers to the railroad linking Yongsan and Sinuiju in 1906. Even during the Japanese colonial era, it was a major means of transportation between North and South Korea. The train stopped operating for many years in the midst of war and division, but after the 2000 North-South summit, the Gyeongui Line restoration project began, and in 2009, a wide area train from Seoul Station to Munsan Station was opened. At this time, the Yongsan Line section of 6.3km connecting 'Yongsan ~ Gajwa' was made underground and made the Gyeongui Line Forest Road on the ground. It was natural for publishers to make books around Hongik University.

   In addition to the booth, various exhibits on the theme of books are installed outdoors in the Gyeongui Line. After the cultural walk, a book sculpture resembling the shape of a book stuck in a bookshelf is attached to a wall on an outdoor seat. If you are looking at sculptures engraved with the titles of books such as &lt;Considerations from Prison&gt;, &lt;What is History&gt;, and &lt;My Cultural Heritage Interpreter&gt;, I would like to take out a book and read it. There is also a girl statue at the end climbing a ladder to take out a book.

   If you go through the forest of text and go down to the Wow Gogga Expressway, it is the famous 'Book Street Station'. When the train was on the Gyeongui Line, it was located between Sekyori Station and Sogang Station, making it a book street station. At the bottom, traces of Gyeongui Line railroad tracks and crushed stone are visible. There are a lot of people taking photos to leave memories in the vicinity of Book Street Station, which has been stylishly decorated in mint colors.
