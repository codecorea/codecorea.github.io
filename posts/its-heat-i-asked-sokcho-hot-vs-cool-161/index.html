  <div class="txt_p">
   If you think of cool food in summer, maybe the first rank is cold. In Sokcho, Hamheung Naengmyeon has naturally been popularized since many displaced people from Hamgyeong-do settled down. There are still many famous Hamheung Naengmyeon restaurants in Sokcho. In addition to Hamheung Naengmyeonok, which was opened in 1951 and is known as the oldest Hamheung Naengmyeon in South Korea, there are several Naengmyeon restaurants with guaranteed flavors such as Ijo-myeonok, Wonsan-myeonok, and Dancheon Restaurant.

   Among them, ‘Yangban Dak Hamheung Naengmyeon’, located directly opposite Hamheung Naengmyeonok, tastes delicious, but is made with healthy ingredients to make healthy naengmyeon. It was also recognized as a 'good restaurant' through the TV program &lt;Food X File&gt;.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Yangban Dakham Heung Naengmyeon is made with natural ingredients instead of chemical seasonings. Natural ingredients and formulations have been studied in order to preserve the taste of food. Myeongtaehoe, which is made with orphan meat and various vegetables, and enters Sokcho-style Hamheung Naengmyeon, is also seasoned without using chemical seasonings such as MSG.

   If you order Hamheung Naengmyeon, you can get some warm broth. Few people would respond to the first mouth saying, "Wow, it's delicious!"

   Noodles are also made with sweet potato starch and squid ink without adding chemical ingredients such as colorants. The firm texture of noodles is alive. The cold radish and the radish served together do not have a pungent taste. This is because 4 times vinegar is used instead of glacial acetic acid, which was used in a cold noodle house. The menu includes Hamheung Naengmyeon, which is served with boiled broth, and light and cold flavored Naengmyeon, as well as yukgaejang, galbitang, and meatball seasoned rice cake dumpling soup. In addition, Hamheung Naengmyeon + Panja, Water Naengmyeon + Panja set menu for those who only want to enjoy one, Alaska pollock on cold noodles, and Naengmyeon seasoning ingredients are also sold separately.

   Another cool food you can taste in Sokcho is water sashimi. Among them, it is a unique marine war. The water sashimi using squid or ordinary sashimi is familiar, but it is a little strange to say it is a sea water sashimi. Sea water sashimi refers to water sashimi containing sea cucumber and abalone. In Sokcho, the famous place for naval warfare is 'Cheongchosumulhoe'. This house specializes in water sashimi and subsuk, making mulsu broth with fear of dead bone. It is said that Korean red pepper powder and fruits are added to the bone gravy, and it is used after maturing for more than a month in a ripening warehouse. The water sashimi, seasoned with fresh seafood on fresh broth stocked with ice cubes, is a delicacy in the summer. The sea water sashimi adds sea cucumber and abalone, which has a good flavor, and adds to the fun of chewing.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Sokcho along the sea is rich in seafood. So, foods using seafood are also diverse. The appeal of Sokcho seafood is the freshness of the ingredients. The hot food that makes full use of its merits is overturned. As for the restaurant name, Sokcho Abalone Seafood Ttukbaejang, the restaurant has only one menu. It started as a small shop at Dongmyeong Port and expanded the space while riding word-of-mouth. Nevertheless, it is often necessary to wait in line for a weekend. The pot is filled with seafood such as live abalone, scallops, shrimp, mussels, and shellfish. If you look at the seafood piled up on top of the earthenware pot, the mouth water will overtake. First, eat a scallop, make a space, and put a live abalone into it and cook it.
