    Jukdo Market is regarded as the best market in Pohang. Perhaps because of the vitality of live fish, this place is always full of energy. This is why it is always exciting to see the market that there is everything except nothing. Let's go to Jukdo Market, a 'paradise of taste' and 'the scene of life' where you can taste not only various live fish but also snow crab, octopus, and Guamegi!
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    In life, there are times when energy is lost in a reality that does not have anything at will. In such a case, the market is a special drug. I assure you that just one day, as soon as possible, a glimpse of the marketers' daily routine starting at 3:00 AM will automatically transform a limb that is sobbing like a squid that is missing. The heart also gets hot. It's enough to just look at them when everyone is asleep and start their day earlier than anyone else. In the fish market, the vitality of the 'raw' that lives and breathes also adds strength. For us, it's just 'delicious things', but the gestures of the fresh fish that keep trying to escape from the red rubber basin, whether they know the future or not and are still alive, are powerful and lovely.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was a long editorial describing the vitality of the market. A market is created wherever people gather. When people gather, various items gather along with them, and when people leave, the market quietly disappears. People and markets, the two are inseparable, so the market is a people. For the same reason, a variety of 'jangs' stand across the country. Most large markets are basically daily markets (permanent markets), but also serve as 5-day and 7-day markets. Among the traditional markets called Naro of each city, I visited Jukdo Market in Pohang at the end of winter. If you want the end of winter and the start of spring, now is the time to go, and if you need to taste Guamegi deeply, you should visit Jukdo Market in January.

    Jukdo-dong, where Jukdo Market is located, was an island as its name suggests. The surrounding rivers, such as Chilseong Stream and Yanghak Stream, were absorbed into the land by reinstatement. Looking at the current map, I wonder where the island was, but there were islands such as Daedo, Haedo, and Songdo in the estuary of the Hyeongsan River. Jukdo, which was a swampy area, was called 'Reed Island' because it was reeded to become 'Dae Island'. When it was changed to Chinese characters, it got the name 'Jukdo'. These islands were called 'island'. The island's large bridge guarding the Posco Bridge proves that there are now disappearing islands. An official from the Public Relations Office of the Pohang City Hall added, "Around October 2013, if the waterway connecting Dongbin Inner Port and Hyeongsan River survives after the completion of Dongbin Inner Port construction, you will be able to feel the mood of the time."

  <div class="txt_p">
   The day of Jukdo Market starts at 5 AM. It is common to think of Jukdo Market as having only fresh fish, seafood, and dried fish. The same is true if you imagined a market with a small port where you can taste Pohang Guamegi over Jukdo Market. This is not just a fish market. It is a large-scale traditional market that includes not only agricultural and food products, fruits and vegetables, but also bakery and mill food clothing shoes, hanbok and futon coma. These various items are located in 148,000 square meters (about 45,000 pyeong) of land and over 2,500 stores. It is a space suitable for the traditional market that boasts the largest on the east coast.

   It wasn't that huge from the beginning. After liberation, the seat that gathered one by one to eat and live along the current parking lot of Chilsungcheon was the beginning. It was when I was hungry. Mothers who went out to put their mouths in the mouth bite this, saying, “I will not be bitten by this child.” As POSCO entered the early 1970s, Jukdo Market leaps into the national market. Jukdo Market and Posco, which were called double-headed wagons leading the Pohang economy, face each other across the Hyeongsan River.

   As mentioned earlier, Jukdo Market is huge. If you just go there, you will often wander around because you can't find the parking lot. Get a guide to the Jukdo Market at the Jukdo Market Customer Support Center located near Jukdo-dong Ogeori. The friendly answer comes back to the question, "Where do you go and eat?"

   If you find a market on the weekend, it's easier to park if you find a public parking lot or a peace parking lot that is a little farther away than to take a car near the Pohang Suhyup. If you're looking for a way, it's a good idea to walk around Chilseong-ro and Bokgae parking lot. The road leading to Pohang Suhyup is easy to determine the direction by touching the entrance of various alleys of Jukdo Market, including fresh fish market and fresh fish market. If you are full of power, it is also fun to go around every corner of your favorite alley with your explorer's instincts.

    Clothing, food, hanbok, agricultural products, rice cakes, chicken houses, and alleys that are invisible to the sea are willing to rush to Guamegi Street. Although it is finished, you can still see Pohang Guamegi. Herring used to be the main ingredient in the past, but it has been replaced by saury as the catch has decreased. If saury is stored at 10 degrees Celsius and below 10 degrees Celsius, then when the day gets cold, the ship is split and the intestines are removed. Pohang people enjoy the whole dried 'tongmari' rather than the 'badge' with the intestines removed. High protein nutritious food, Pohang winter delicacy Guamegi. The price is also cheap (?), So it is more appreciated by the common people. Although it is at the end of winter, it is regrettable to come to Pohang and leave Guamegi.

    There is still some season left, but I can see the bridge. The saliva builds up. The end of winter will eventually lead to spring. You can taste winter and spring delicacies together, so there is nothing to envy at this moment. From Gaetgo-dong and Min-go-dong to the rare Daegu that is as big as an adult's forearm, octopus and snow crab is a paradise of taste. Pohang, which is on the same east coast as it is commonly known as Yeongdeok and Uljin, is a must-see.

   A whale shed is facing each other in a market. Reporters who eat anything except dog meat have also been weakened in front of whale meat. If you want to check the reason, bite ~! Whale catching is illegal. Whales that can be tasted like this are all drowned in the net due to unavoidable circumstances. Occasionally, the newspaper says that the ransom is 'mink whale', and one of their destinations is here.

    What is this again? Although it is a fish, its appearance is not unusual. A fish with a torso and without a tail is a fish that looks like a hell. It's sunfish. Pohang is considered a delicacy. If you cook and boil it, the white flesh is the same as Cheongpo-muk. It has no color, taste, or smell, and it is a feature of this guy. In Pohang, every major event, such as a wedding or funeral, goes up. Pohang Ajimae are working hard on sunfish. It is hard to believe that his identity is fish, as he sees it boiled and cut squarely. Try eating if it's bothered to ask. It really has no taste. The texture is similar to jelly. Since it was eaten in the grass, it is quite edible to eat something like konjac. The world is wide and there is a lot to eat!

    The auction takes place every morning at the Pohang Market Commission between the Pohang Suhyupang and Dongbinnae Port. The nearby Sinpo Port Fish Market is also starting a day fast. Good quality fresh fish can be obtained at reasonable prices, so many people are looking from a distance. The appreciation of missing the auction time is replaced by looking at the net work of the couple who came back from the end of herring. Now that I've looked around, it's time for a full-fledged tasting. I am thinking about whether to eat Gwamegi, sashimi, or water sashimi. He said to himself, "Would you mind me?" Asks. One person can eat sashimi. The natural flounder will cost 20,000 won for 1kg, and the flatfish and eel for 15,000 won will eat. This is only the raw value. If you add 3,000 won for the extra long price, you can taste rice and spicy soup. Even if you order 12,000 won water, the spicy soup comes out. If you want to eat sashimi and also want to eat sashimi, you can just add the seasoning after opening the sashimi. If you add 4,000 won, you can get the water sauce and spicy soup. Be generous. Even if you are not a sweetheart, I think of a drink. The spring spreads through the mouth of the soft legs. Come on spring day!
