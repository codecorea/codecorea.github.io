    The Bangseonmun Valley was located upstream of Hancheon, the longest river in Jeju Island. Since ancient times, many scholars and poets have visited and enjoyed the wind, and it has a superb view that is considered to be one of the 10 best places in Yeongju. One of them, 'Yeonggu Chunhwa', refers to the spring scenery of the Bangseonmun Valley, and the flowers blooming around the valley reflect beautifully in the valley water. Yeongsanhong and true flowers bloom in every place where the gaze touches, and even if you look at it, it will heal itself.

    Unfortunately, there aren't many days where you can admire this view. Since the agar that forms the basis of the Bangseonmun Valley is a dry stream, the water does not open until rain or snow accumulated in the winter melts. In order to tackle ‘Yeongguchunhwa’ in the Bangseonmun Valley, it is time to get along well in the spring.

    However, we cannot wait only when it rains. Even if you missed 'Yeongu Chunhwa', the Bangseonmun Valley itself is attractive enough, so I recommend you to visit it at any time. It is only a 10-minute drive from downtown Jeju, and when entering the valley, a mysterious landscape with a completely different dimension unfolds. Even in a valley where water does not flow, the terrain and geology surrounding the valley are so mysterious that it is difficult to escape easily once you step in. As if entering a new world, he is obsessed with strange feelings, and he continues to rush through the rocks.

    Originally, the Bangseonmun Valley was called ‘Deunggung-gwe’, but in Jeju, it means ‘a rock that was lifted through a hole’. It is also referred to as ‘Deungyong-gu’ by borrowing the kanji, and recently it was named Bangseonmun, which means ‘the place where Shinseon visits’. The name Bang Sun-moon comes from a legend that has been passed down for a long time. According to legend, every year on a lucky day, the fairies descended from the sky and bathed in Baeknokdam, and every time Hallasan Mountain God had to go beyond the large rock gate in the valley to the human world. It is a story that one day, the mountain god of Hallasan broke it and stole the appearance of the fairies taking a bath and then wandered Baeknokdam as a white deer with the wrath of the Jade Emperor. The funny legend attached to the name makes me laugh.

    If you go down the wooden stairs at the entrance to the valley, you will see a huge rock formation, which is the Bangseonmun Gate. It looks like a door when viewed from a distance, with a hole large enough for dozens of people to fly in and out of a huge rock, like a cave that has been drilled back and forth. Especially when it is rainy or overcast on a cloudy day, even the spiritual energy is wrapped around the rocky gate. It feels like a door connecting the world to the world.

    Seeing the works that nature has cultivated for a long time, did the old ancestors think the same way? It is easy to find Maae-myeong (磨 崖 銘, written on a rock), which has inspirations for it. There are more than 50 names in the Bangseonmun Valley, and there are still many bright letters, so their historical value is high.

    Trekking in the Bangseonmun Valley is almost an exploration, as there are no well-polished paths or separate guide signs. Therefore, you should always be aware of your way back and be safe. Don't go where it looks dangerous, and it's a good idea to accompany your party.

    If you cross over a rocky valley, you will see a cow with standing water. This is the place where you can see it only on rainy days. Because of luck, raindrops began to fall from the cloudy sky on the first day I visited the Bangseonmun Valley, and water quickly flowed into the valley. 'Biwaya Falls', which is difficult to see even after a few visits, welcomed strangers. In fact, it is a mini waterfall that is a little shy to call it a waterfall after a short fall, but for some reason it looks good with the Bangseonmun Valley.

   Some ways to enjoy Bangseonmun Valley
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   In the meantime, the Bangseonmun Valley has not been known much more than the magnificent scenery. Thanks to this, along with the title of “hidden unexplored” in Jeju City, it remains untouched for many years and remains the same as the ancestors enjoyed the wind. These days, as the beautiful scenery of Bangseonmun Valley is spread through the Internet, more and more people are looking for it. This is Yoo Bae-gil, Choi Ik-hyun of Myeonam, and there are several ‘roads’ that go through Bangseonmun Valley, including Aura Ollegil. In particular, Aura Olle-gil is a course that follows the agar from Koji Bridge to Bangseonmun Valley and is worth a walk. It is good to walk along a forest path along the river as if you were taking a leisurely stroll. It takes about 2 to 2 hours and a half to reach 5 km from Yeolanjioreum through Bangseonmun Valley. On the way, there are many things to see, such as an appeal, so it is not boring.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   For a family trip, you can take a round tour of the valley lightly and then drop by an experiential learning center nearby. The Bangseonmun Valley Chocolate Experience Center (064-744-0093), located next to the Jeju Art Center, runs several experiences that children will love, such as making chocolate.
   <br/>
   Every May, a festival (Bangseonmun Festival Committee 064-728-4802) is held around the Bangseonmun Valley. There are also concerts to sit on the cool valley rocks and watch them, and there are small but fruitful programs such as baekiljang, poetry song, and pungryu yard. If the schedule of the Bangseonmun Festival overlaps during your trip to Jeju, take some time to stop by. It brings a little fun to the journey.
