    A trip to Jongju to go to Dangjin, Chungnam. With Mt.Ami in the center, Mt. and Mt. It is a relatively low mountain, such as Ami Mountain at 349.5m above sea level, Mongsan at 298.4m and Dabulsan at 321m, but it is not easy.

    The mountain feels different depending on the course you are experiencing. I am very excited about the excitement that Dangjin's Jinsan will offer. I would like to walk around the sun, so I depart from Mongsan to the north. Myeoncheon-myeon Office ~ Mongsan ~ Amisan ~ Dabulsan ~ Jukdong-ri, take pictures slowly at a distance of about 6km

    In front of the Myeoncheonmyeon Office, Pungrakru, in 1852, Lee Gwan-yeong, a county munitioner at the time, attached a placard with the name 'Pungrakru' to wish peace and a good harvest with the people. There is a guide map of Mongsanseong Marugil Trail in the west direction of Pungrakru. This trail leads to Mount Ami, so it's a good idea to keep an eye on it.

    In Mt. Mong, there was a Temo-type acid. In the Three Kingdoms, it is said to be a castle built actively by Baekje, and its form is an acid that surrounds the mountain along the 7-8 part contour line of the mountain. As you climb, you can see the story of Mongsanseong on the signboard. In addition, each of the estimated sites of the watchtower, the pavilion installed for the defense, surveillance, communication, and command of the castle, is numbered so that you can directly see the scenery from that point.

    After passing the center of Mongsan, there are hiking trails leading from the forked road to Mt. Ami. If you go downhill in the mountains, the tranquil atmosphere will gradually fade away, but rather, it will become more calm, and even the mountain fog will make the atmosphere seem strangely flowing. Signs with poems are provided here and there, and the taste is different. It runs naturally from downhill to uphill. You can feel the connection between Mongsan and Amisan naturally. Amisan was called Soisan in the Joseon Dynasty. At that time, 'Yeojiseo' records that Soi Mountain extends from Mongsan.

    Amisan is located in various places such as Dangjin, Boryeong, Gunwi, Busan, and Hongcheon. It is said that such condensed milk contains the wind from the days when smallpox was popular. Amic acid is one of China's famous products.

    A pavilion is erected at the top of Mount Ami. It is said to be the highest mountain in Dangjin, but the gaze cannot extend far enough to create some regret. It is a pity for a moment, and I think that the view of Dangjin overlooking is not the charm of Amisan. If you look closely to the south, the mountain range that stretched far from Mt. The landscape of the hilly plains spreads around it. Either one is as drowsy as the back of a cat taking a nap without sharpness. As the name of Myeoncheon, it is also a landscape that conveys the features of a town with many rivers.

    If you turn your eyes west, you will see a mountain with a flat top, like a fedora. It is Dabul Mountain, the last mountain of the last week. There is a thrilling event in between, so it is a bridge called a bridge. It is quite dizzy at 19.5m in height and 76m in length. It is natural that the wind gathers on a mountain pass. As the leg strength is released when the journey is over, it throws tension and doubles the fun of the lord.

    'Namu Avitta Buddha', which was reminiscent of the recurring thoughts of Ami and Dabul Mountain ... Ami (mountain) Dabul (mountain), I guess it wasn't intended, but it goes well with it. A sperm was built based on the rock of the summit of Mt. The coniferous and broad-leaved communities are divided based on the ridge line, and the color is also impressive.
