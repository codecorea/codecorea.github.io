    Geumgangsan Island was said to be after the meal. It is a proverb that needs to be reconsidered once before the national holiday of Chuseok. We prepared for those who left the hometown and lived on the road, as well as those who ran the highway and headed for the hometown. A restaurant on the highway, set off to your hometown with soothing body and mind as a delicacy at a rest area!

    When did it start? Enjoying a good meal at a highway rest area, as well as a dessert at a coffee shop. The rest area, which was a place where people take a break from hunger with snacks such as walnut sweets, roasted potatoes, squid, fish cake, and udon, is still evolving. It has settled not only for food but also for clothing stores such as outdoor specialty stores. From the rest stop to shopping, it is an era that is possible. Maybe you can't forget the food you tasted at the rest stop, and you might have to run to the stop. Wouldn't it be that the rest area that connected between reality and the destination like a stepping stone becomes an independent 'island' rather than a stepping stone? In the near future, a trip map to the rest area may be created.

Let's take a look at the characteristics of each rest area, starting with the gourmet on the highway and the delicacy of the rest area. The immediate feeling of satiety in your mouth will help you remember the rest area for a long time. I hope you will find it useful for Chuseok, who is approaching your nose.

   One of the first delicacies of the Yeongdong Expressway is the Korean beef rice cake dudeok steak at Hoengseong Rest Area in Gangneung. Many people are looking for Hanustake for 10,000 won. However, there is a fixed amount per day, so it is difficult to taste without going until early lunch. If you haven't tasted Hanustake, let's soothe the sadness with Hanwoo Bulgogi. You can enjoy Korean beef soup at Munmak Rest Area (Gangneung) and Yeoju Rest Area (Incheon). The most popular menu on the highway in 2013 is Deokpyeong Beef Soup Rice at Deokpyeong Rest Area (Incheon). Deokpyeong Rest Area is followed by seafood sundubu jjigae (6000 won) and Anseong Rest Area (Seoul) Anseong Custom Gukbap (formerly Anseong Ok Gukbap, 7,000 won). After all, at the rest area, soup that can be solved with one bowl is popular.

    On the rest of the highways, except for the Gyeongbu, Seohaean, and Yeongdong Expressways, which we introduced earlier, let's look at the places where the famous spot is added as a delicacy to rest areas. Local delicacies are strong. At Andong Rest Area on the Chuo Expressway, you can taste Andongan mackerel, a specialty of Andong. Salted salt, selected for tasting fish in inland areas, is loved for its unique taste in the 21st century. There are also dishes created by adding two delicacies to the edge of the Seomjin River. The Namhae Expressway Seomjin River Rest Area is prepared with Cheongmaesil re-bibimbap and re-hybrid soup. On the Daejeon Tongyeong Expressway, Ginseng Land Rest Area (Hamnam) and Hamyang Rest Area (Tongyeong), specialties such as Wanggalbitang and Baekyeon Bapsang are also popular menus by Gilson.

    As you run on other highways and national highways, you will continue to encounter rest areas. Unlike in the past, these rest areas are not places to pass by. Travelers who have exploded from the “Maika era” in the 1990s have now remembered a delicious rest area and visit there. It is now time to enjoy a good meal at a rest stop according to your taste. If you remember this, it will be a small force for those who are willing to handle the traffic crisis and head home. Wait, Hangawi!
