   Snow crab is one of the best on the winter coast. Usually crab legs are elongated and named like bamboo. If you solve it in Chinese characters, it becomes Jukhae (竹 蟹). Red snow crab leading to red crab is similar to snow crab, and sometimes it can be mistaken as snow crab.
   <br/>
   Where is it? The neighborhood where you live is different. Most crabs live in depths of 30-1800m and red crabs in soft mud or sandy bottoms. At the depth of 450 ~ 600m, blue crab, a hybrid of snow crab and red crab, is located. It resembles a snow crab and is called ‘You too snow crab’.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Before tasting red snow crab, let's take a look. The highest peak of snow crab is bakdae crab. Some people consider ‘박달대게’ as a proper noun. Whether it is domestic or imported, if the flesh is full, it is ‘박달대게’. Normally, domestic prices are set by maridang and imported by weight. You can also see snow crabs in Sokcho, known as the main area for red crabs. The price is flexible, but the average kg is about 100,000 won.

   It is usually crab although it is less full. The snow crab has a slightly dark brown color instead of the bright red color of the red crab. The color of the snow crab is more noticeable. After the crab is boiled, it turns into a pale pink color with a golden color. The red crab, which was red before steaming, is vivid after it is boiled. There are differences in appearance, but the difference is obvious in taste. If you taste crab and red crab together, you can feel the difference in taste.

   The crab's flesh is sweet. Sweet mussels melt gently in your mouth. When the soft and sweet crab comes into red rather than taste, it comes with a salty taste. Red crabs, which have a relatively salty taste, are often thought to be cheaper than snow crabs. Some of the crabs are filled with red crabs, boasting a ransom equivalent to snow crabs. Still, most of them cannot keep up with the price. Hong crabs, which are caught a lot at this time, boast a ransom ranging from 20,000 won to 6-70,000 won per kg. Red crab with various ransom, where should I eat something?
