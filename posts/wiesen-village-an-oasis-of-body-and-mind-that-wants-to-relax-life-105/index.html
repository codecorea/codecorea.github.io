   I unfolded the map and pondered where to go. Tourists face the tropical mood, palm trees, the jade sea running over the white sand, and the hot sun. Jeju Island has already become a landscape by its name. There is also a resting place to quench my thirst like an oasis in my body and mind that wants to rest.

   Bizen Village is in the middle of the Hadori Carrot Field on the east side of Jeju Island. Although it opened this year, it is already a cultural space with industrial design and vintage props among those seeking a trendy lifestyle. Travelers are sheltered with dormitories, penthouses and camping trailers, but they are not just places to sleep. It is a complex cultural space with various facilities for relaxation such as a restaurant hard table, an organic farm cafe beer round, a loft market selling vintage props and longboards, a gallery displaying lighting collections and an outdoor swimming pool.
