   The unspoiled nature, the innocent spirit, and the friendly scenery and memories full of old memories are often referred to as the “hometown of the mind”. Gangwon-do and Jeongseon-do are one of those places. A place where Arari rhythms are formed under the clean foothills of Baekdu-daegan, and all kinds of nostalgic things such as oil fields and old houses fill the eyes, mouth, and heart. Jeongseon meets at the beginning of the winter and greets the traveler with warmth like a briquette.

   Abandoned mine, Samtan Artmine, reborn as an art space full of emotion
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Can we talk about the history of Jeongseon except the 1960s and 1970s when the coal industry was booming? At that time, dozens of coal mines were operated in Jeongseon, and it was economically plentiful enough to say, 'A dog also carries money.' However, as the coal industry declined, most of the abandoned mines were in order, and tens of thousands of miners were scattered. The Samcheok throne, located at the foot of Mt. Hambaek, also endured this crisis. In 2001, it was eventually abandoned after 40 years of history. Samtan Artmine, newly opened in this place, added 'Samtan', which is an abbreviation of Samcheok Throne, to 'Artmine,' which means mining, not art, but art.

    This space was also used as a filming location for the popular drama &lt;Descendants of the Sun&gt;. On the other side of the exhibition room, the male protagonist was provided with military uniforms to take a commemorative photo. Thanks to this, the elderly are happy to wear military uniforms and take photos as if they were the main characters in the drama. At Samtan Museum, you can find equipment used by miners, as well as related documents such as pay stubs and resumes from Samcheok throne employees. It is even more interesting for seniors who clearly remember the days when the coal industry flourished.

    The factory building, which was used to manufacture and repair coal mine machinery, was reborn as a vintage restaurant, where a special menu called 'Miner's Lunch Box' is presented. The lunch box, which was made with memories of the father who was actually a miner, is well suited to the taste of the elderly, with the rice cooked in a tightly pressed manner and the rich side dishes that feel luxurious. Samtan Artmine is the only place where most of the exhibition space is indoors to avoid Jeongseon's bitter winter wind. There are various rest areas such as restaurants and cafes as well as elevators, so it is good for elderly people to take a leisurely tour. If you purchase an integrated ticket including a miner's lunch box, you can enjoy the view more reasonably.

   Starting with Seonam Village in Yeongwol, observation decks have emerged all over the place that overlooks the shape of the Korean Peninsula. One of them is Jeongseon Bamseom, where the Donggang flows slowly along the circumference of the island. In order to fully appreciate the view of Bamseom, which resembles the Korean Peninsula, you have to climb on the skywalk located in a barracks.
