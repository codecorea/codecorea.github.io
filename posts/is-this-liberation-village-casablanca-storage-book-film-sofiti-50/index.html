   Liberation Village, an exotic building with old buildings and old signs. If you walk a little further on this unfamiliar and familiar street, you will be waiting for Seoul in the 1960s, with a building on a steep hill. In the spring when the rain falls, I left for the pleasure of the Liberation Village.

   Liberation Village, the name of the overseas Koreans who returned to their homeland in 1945 and the displaced people. No matter how you listen, this strange neighborhood is emerging as a hot street. Introducing the hot place of Haebangchon, where you can enjoy the charms different from Itaewon and Gyeongridangil, already filled with the smell of 2000s.

   In small spaces, people are gathering together. It's mostly foreigners too. Even the orderer is a charming foreigner with bushy beards, so it's easy to wonder if it's overseas. If you look back and outside, this is a liberation village.

   Casablanca, run by two brothers from Morocco, has a taste of Moroccan that is so good that Daniel Tudor, author of 'A Country Who Lost Miracles, Lost Joy', said, 'It's much better than Itaewon's expensive food.' . Most of the ingredients and condiments used for the large and thick sandwiches for the price are real exhaust through their hands. We hope that foreigners can taste their hometown at an affordable price.

   If exotic restaurants tempt you at the beginning of the liberation village, the world of those who are quietly living their lives without signboards over the steep hillsides raises questions. Among them, 'Storage Book &amp; Film', which is located near the three-way intersection of emerging churches, is an independent bookstore that started with the sale of film cameras and has now expanded to the distribution of independent publications.
