   Also, grill the meat. Han-soo, the eldest son of Baeksu-gundal, an unsuccessful filmmaker In-mo, Mi-yeon decides to divorce, and her junior high school daughter Min-kyung. A 69-year-old mother has been grilling meat every day since five families gathered. Did you have a little soju? The eldest son takes out a vague old story. It is a memory of Changgyeongwon family outing as a child. The cherry blossoms are flying, the meat is ripening, the youngest daughter Miyeon is singing and singing, and the second mother-in-law is reading and reading (?), And the mood is good. It was a time when the family became aging now. At that time, the mother, who only smiled and grilled meat, immediately proposed.
   <br/>
   “Let's go, picnic. My mom also wants to go. ”
   <br/>
   That...
   <br/>
   “Eulwangni Beach.”
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Eulwangni Beach is the western edge of Yeongjongdo. It goes up north along the beach, followed by Seonnyeo Baeui Beach, Eulwangni Beach, and Wangsan Beach. If you go further south, it is Muuido Island. In the summer of last year, SBS entertainment program &lt;Running Man&gt; was filmed here. Muuido Island connects Silmido Island to the north and Somuuido Island to the south. Somuuido has a small “small”, but it cannot be confined to its meaning. It has been the center of Muuido for a long time, and people have lived since 300 years ago. Muuido, a large island, was a ranch until the end of Joseon. A bridge was laid in 2011 between Somuuido Island and Muuido Island, and now it is a walking distance.
   <br/>
   The road of Muui sea that goes around Somuuido is also spotlighted. The length is about 2.5km, and it is enough for an hour to walk by turtle. You have the pleasure of walking slowly through the island where you can't even hear the sound of a car engine. It is also romantic to look at the sea scenery under your feet from the pavilion of Ansan, the summit of the island. You can also see airplanes flying from and to Incheon International Airport. It is not too far from the land. I haven't heard a lot of word-of-mouth yet, so I enjoy a leisurely island trip.
   <br/>
   On the other hand, Silmido in the north of Muuido Island is as famous as the movie title. Silmi Beach is a perfect place for the summer. Muido Island forms a double wall with Hana Beach on the main island. In Mui-do, Horyonggoksan is also a famous spot. You can embrace a wide view by light hiking. There are three islands, Modo, Shindo, and Shido, on the north side of Mui Island with Yeongjongdo in between. It leads to the bridge, aka Samhyungseom Island. There are drama shooting sets such as &lt;Sad Love Story&gt; and &lt;Full House&gt;. Baemikkumi Sculpture Park is very interesting in Modo, the very first island. Strange sculptures color the edge of the beach. Along with Yeongjongdo's beach, it is an island suitable for a day trip.

   The love of a fairy who embraces a rock
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   In Yeongjong-do, a promenade was opened along the coast of Yongyu. From Geojampo in the south, it passes through the Maanian Beach and continues to Seonnyeo Rock, Eulwangri, and Wangsan Beach. It is a 1-hour course from Geojampo to Macian Beach, a 2-hour drive from Macian to Seonyeo Baeui Beach, and a 3-hour course from Seonyeo Baeui Beach to Eulwangri and Wangsan Beach. It is advisable to step in time to find the tide on an autumn day when the summer heat is gone.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Among these beaches, the place that &lt;Aging Family&gt; found is the winter sea of Seonyeo Bai Wei. In the play, Miyeon's boyfriend confidently said 'Eulwang-ri', but the shape of the fairy-tale rock is clearly captured at the end of the sandy beach where the family arrived due to his controversy. Hagiya also belongs to Eulwangri (dong). The first child in the family to run toward the sea is a mother-in-law. He is 44 years old. However, the first word of the mother who suggested the outing is very realistic.
   <br/>
   "cold. Just go. ”
   <br/>
   Min-kyung, a granddaughter and daughter, is an adult. She leads her grandmother's hand and the gear goes to the white sand. Only then did the rest of the family move slowly towards the sea. Han-mo and Mi-yeon's boyfriend wrestle, and then the whole family entangled in the sand. It is full of cool smiles. It is a happy time for the aging family. It is no different from any other family. Family photos are also taken with a cell phone. Everyone laughs brightly. In the distant Balchi, the rock of the fairy is grown up. Because of the high tide, the rock of the sea disappeared and the lonely rock on the sea was lonely.

   Seonnyeo Rock is a rock that stands like a tower when viewed from a distance. But as you get closer, the image resembling the name is revealed. It is a rock that the fairies came down and played on a rainbow. There are other legends. A fairy tale, who was driven out of the anger of the Jade Emperor, met a rock bachelor and married. One year later, the Jade Emperor called the fairy again, but when he rebelled, he thundered. Even if they died, they didn't know that they would fall together. In the end, it is said that it became a rock of one body while standing. If you look closely, you can see the fairy holding the rock tightly. It is also said that the fairy tale rock strengthens the relationship between the couple or the couple.

   Family members are different. In fact, the tidal flat experience is possible because there is a large difference between the tide and the seaside. There are many who are looking for a family outing. At low tide, the sea rocks are lush. It is like a fairy and a child of a rock, and it surrounds the sheep. The white sandy beach that embraces the sea is also beautiful. If you can afford it, you can stay a little late. The reason why lovers often visit is because they can be easily moved from Seoul, and in addition, the beautiful sunset of the West Sea creates a romantic atmosphere. In the drama &lt;Boys over Flowers&gt;, the place where Joo Jun-pyo (Lee Min-ho) confessed his love to the golden grass (Koo Hye-seon) and kissed him for the first time, also in the drama &lt;Gold me out!&gt; The scene recalling the past day with Kim Da-hyun) is also the sea that is the background of a beautiful relationship in the play.

   On weekdays, you need to get off the bus at Incheon International Airport. However, the West Sea train runs one more stop at Incheon International Airport Station and stops at Yongyu Temporary Station. It is an hour and 10 minutes from Seoul Station. You can also take it from Hongik University Station, Digital Media City Station, and Gimpo Airport Station. The transportation is convenient, but the scenery of the sea off the coast of Incheon, seen through a large window, is spectacular.

   In Eulwangri, shellfish grilling is an indispensable delicacy. It does not fall into a drama or movie set in the background, and it stimulates my taste. &lt;Aging family&gt; is no exception. It is a family that likes to eat and drink. However, putting cold water in a pleasant picnic meeting atmosphere will eventually be a drink. Mi-yeon, who sacrificed for her brother's back pants, heads for her mother. The fight spreads to the side table where the gear has nothing to do with it. At that moment, the aging family is reunited. Mi-in's mother-in-law also has a family relationship. A word he threw brings a warm smile.
