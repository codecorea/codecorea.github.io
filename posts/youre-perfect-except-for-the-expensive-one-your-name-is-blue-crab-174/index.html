    There is a food that reminds me of the proverb, ‘Even if two people die while eating, they do n’t know.’ If you are on a diet, you should never get close to the rice thief crab. The soy sauce crab sauce can taste the sweet and sour blue crab flesh like 'sashi', and the seasoned crab sauce has a spicy and sweet seasoning and vegetables.

    What comes to mind when you say ‘Gunsan’? Seonyudo Island of Gogunsan Islands? Where Jeolla-do's hearty table starts? Let's take a look at the map for a while. Crossing the stem of Geum River in Seocheon, South Chungcheong Province, the land of Jeolla Province begins. Gunsan is at the starting point. After Gunsan, Gimje and Buan to the south, and Iksan and Jeonju to the east. It is a town that has both the West Sea tidal flats and the Honam plains on both sides. A rich land with fresh water, salt water, and even plains. In addition, it bears the stems of the West Sea and the Geum River, which is advantageous for transportation in and out of the Korean Peninsula. The stem of the Geum River, which separates the boundary between Gunsan and Seocheon, digs deep into the West Sea from the outside to Ganggyeong, Chungnam, and carries it in one body with the sea.
    <br/>
    This land, which had a natural environment of warmth, was unable to escape the Japanese occupation. The invaders could not know the advantages of Gunsan, which is good for transportation while also providing abundant food in water and water. In the 21st century, it is also the reason why we can make a “modern cultural history trip” just by looking around Gunsan properly. How can heal wounds stuffed with the name 'history'?

   I looked at the overall atmosphere of Gunsan. Today's trip to Gunsan is a very delicious 'blue crab trip'. That they don't know if one dies while they eat! The slender young lady is the main protagonist of the rice thief, who eats two bowls of rice. However, there are so many stories that Gunsan had to just come to eat, so it's a pity to eat crab crab and stop by the Iseongdang bakery.

   Where is that? Thanks to its rich environment, Gunsan has many delicacies. From Korea's oldest bakery &lt;Lee Seongdang&gt; to &lt;Bokseongru&gt;, one of the nation's top five champons, to &lt;Gunsan Sashimi House&gt;, which has the rumor that it boasts the largest scale in Asia. Aside from the crab shop, there are plenty of restaurants and bakeries across the country. In addition, powerful restaurants such as &lt;Daega&gt;, &lt;Gyeok Garden&gt;, and &lt;Han Joo-ok&gt;, famous for their crab dishes, are added. Although not as “touristized” as Jeonju in the neighboring neighborhood, Gunsan here is a taste that can not be missed by gourmets.

   As we know, there are many blue crabs on the west coast. The East Sea is usually snow crab, and the West Sea is blue crab. As the name suggests, crabs are not as hard as shellfish (salt crab), and they are less expensive than snow crabs, so you can enjoy them freely. That doesn't mean the taste is falling, so I think there is more filial piety for fishermen.

   However, there were many difficulties in storing blue crabs. Live crabs eat my flesh over time. Now, when the technology has developed, it is only necessary to freeze and store fresh blue crabs with 'rapid freezing', but where would that be? It is in the same context as the development of chopped salt in a hard land located inland inside the stem of Geumgang.

   Fishermen who had to keep blue crabs for a long time thought of salting. Initially, the crab intestines were removed and salted. The purpose was to keep the crab for a long time without damaging it. However, like this salted blue crab, it can be stored for a long time without being damaged, but it is too salty. The blue crab has a light but salty taste.
