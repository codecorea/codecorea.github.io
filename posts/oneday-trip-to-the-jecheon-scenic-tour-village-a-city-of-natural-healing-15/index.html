   The Jecheon Sightseeing Tour Village Tour Course consists of three tour village projects and a program that combines tourist attractions located nearby. In order to transform Jecheon's hidden treasures, Gyodong folk painting villages and republic villages into tourist destinations, the “Own Culture and Arts Cooperative” was launched. The Folk Painting Institute in Minhwa Village has developed a variety of murals, experiences, and souvenirs based on folk paintings. The former school, Gongjeon School, offers a variety of enzyme experiences and enzyme meals that are responsible for family health. 'History of History', which is not used at present, is being revived as a 'woodtrain' woodcarving workshop.
