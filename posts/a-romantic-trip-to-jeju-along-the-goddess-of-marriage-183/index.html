   scene # 1. Wisdom and Hyunwoo's First Meeting and Aewolhan Dam Trail
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Wisdom, who is confused by the uncertain marriage, is on the plane for Jeju alone on the excuse of a business trip. Hyun-woo, who sleeps, leans toward Hyun-woo, who sits in the next seat, and Hyun-woo, who gives wisdom to her shoulders, sees the book she dropped in curiosity. The wisdom that disappeared in an instant as soon as the plane arrived in Jeju. But thanks to a book she forgot, the two of them accidentally reunite the next day, and after a misunderstanding, they start walking along the road.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    On the third morning, Hyunwoo leads the wisdom of going alone. Wisdom is stylish, but he smiles brightly and runs along the coastal promenade. Uh, but where the hell are you ?! Even though she was immersed in the drama, the momentary spirit flashes in the fantastic scenery behind her.
    <br/>
    Aewol Handam Trail. Even though it passed by briefly for only 2 ~ 3 seconds on the screen, it is too much to be considered as such a place. A walkway was created along the coastline of Handam Village located in Aewol-eup, Jeju, and the mood of walking along the path is amazing. Anyone who knows that this wonderful coastal walkway is hidden beneath the roadside is a place that can be counted as the hidden unexplored Jeju of Jeju Island. Nowadays, there are more and more tourists coming to this place through word of mouth and internet.

    From the Aewol Handam Park, which is directly adjacent to the three-way intersection of Seoilju-do and Aewol entrance, go down the stairs to the coast and it is directly connected to the promenade. There is a good walking path from Handam Village to Gwakjiwamul Beach about 1.2km. Looking down from the hill, it has a flexible curve, and it takes about 20 minutes by walking from end to end. Inwardly bent, basalt and white sand, rounded like a mongdol, remind us of the secret beach. The mysterious lava stone statues carved by nature from a long time ago provide a highlight.

    Most of all, the scenery created by the blue sky and the white clouds and the sea glistening with emerald colors, as if popping popcorn, evokes excitement. Just looking at me feels calm and peaceful. As I jump into the landscape and see those who enjoy the sea to their heart's content, I think this is a fresh play. You can always move your mind even during the walk, so it's better to go ready to jump into the sea. Maybe it wasn't in the play, but Wisdom and Hyunwoo might have enjoyed snorkeling or bathing here.

   scene # 2. The road of wisdom and Hyunwoo, from Dosoon Tea Garden to the Dragon Eye
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Is there anything more enjoyable than traveling with a good-hearted person? Jiwoon and Hyunwoo spend a fun time with a hum, but it's not been days since they met. While walking between the tea fields while eating ice cream, the place where the children arrived after running through the truck like an innocent child. This situation is set in the play, and it takes more than an hour and a half by car from the Dosun Tea Garden to the Yongun-eori. It's a story that you can never walk or run on. Probably both places are full of charm, so I would have set it up like that.

    Unlike the Osulloc Seogwang Tea Garden, which is popular among tourists, the Dosun Tea Garden spreads out in the southern part of Hallasan Mountain. Even walking slowly through the green tea field feels like a healing.
    <br/>
    Located in Gujwa-eup, in the eastern part of Jeju, Yongnun-oreum is one of the natural healing spots. Yongnunoreum, which has a graceful curvaceous taste, has also become the background for the films &lt;Wolf Boy&gt; and &lt;Jisel&gt;. It is not very high and the walking path is gentle, so anyone can easily climb it. In the distance, Udo and Seongsan Ilchulbong, opposite Dalangsi Oreum and Adaeng Dareum Oreum, unfold like pictures. In the play, there is a scene where Wisdom and Hyunwoo step on cow dung, sometimes it's a real situation, so be careful with your feet. It's a human road, so cows never try to cover up.

   scene # 3. Lee Joong-Seop Art Museum Dreaming of Pure Love
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    The medium of love that connected wisdom and Hyunwoo was a book about painter Lee Joong-seop. During the trip, the two visit the Lee Joong-Seop Art Museum. The Lee Joong-seop Art Museum in downtown Seogwipo is an art museum commemorating the artist Lee Joong-seop, famous for &lt;The Bull&gt;. Lee Joong-seop, who fleeed to Seogwipo with his family to avoid the Korean War, lived here for about a year and left several works including &lt;The Illusion of Seogwipo&gt;.

    In front of the Lee Joong-seop Art Museum, the residence where the painter Lee Joong-seop and his family lived is preserved. Even though it was reflected in the drama, Lee Joong-seop suffered from the extreme heights of life in which his family lived in a narrow room. However, Lee Joong-seop remembered the days of Seogwipo, where his family lived in needy times, as the happiest time. Looking at his writings and letters displayed at the museum, one can guess how much Lee Jung-seop, who had left his family in Japan, missed those days. Here, sympathy with the pure love of painter Lee Joong-seop reveals his honest thoughts about love and marriage.

    Wisdom and Hyunwoo walk on the road with an awkward heart for some reason, but suddenly thick raindrops begin to fall. It's raining, and it's raining like a heavy rain. Hyun-woo takes off his clothes and covers them with wisdom so that they don't get wet. Soon a giant pinwheel visible behind them. It is a wind farm created on the coastal road between Sinchang and Yongsu in southwestern Jeju. It is famous for its numerous CFs, dramas, and movie locations. Standing underneath the wind power generator, the sound produced by the huge wings spinning can be overwhelming. This coastal road is a great way to enjoy a drive with your lover.

    The sea where Wisdom and Hyunwoo walked along Olle-gil and looked together. They decide to meet there again to confirm their honest feelings toward each other. The beach was like fate to them. You will meet when you follow Olle Trail to the place where it connects to Hwasun Geumsand Beach, the starting point of Olle 10 Course. The beach surrounded by rocky rocks and Brothers Island overlooking Asrai in the distance create an exquisite landscape. The sandy beach, which is so beautiful that your feet will fall out, shines brightly when reflected in the sunlight in line with the nickname “Gold Sand”.
