   Suncheon Bay is a space created between Suncheon City Center and Suncheon Bay Wetland to prevent damage to Suncheon Bay, the world's five largest coastal wetlands. Following the Suncheon Bay International Garden Expo, where 4.5 million people have visited, Suncheon Bay is continuing its reputation as Suncheon Bay Garden. Suncheon Bay Garden is scheduled to be designated as the first national garden in August.

   The name of the national garden is somewhat unfamiliar. Suncheon Bay International Garden Expo increased interest in the garden. Previously, there was a “Act on the Creation and Promotion of Arboretum,” but since the concept of garden was not specified, the contents related to the garden were newly added as the “Act on the Creation and Promotion of Arboretum and Garden.” According to the governing body of the garden, it is divided into national garden, local garden, private garden, and community garden. Among them, Suncheon Bay Garden is the first place designated as national garden. Apart from the details of the law, Suncheon will be the birthplace of garden culture that is worthy of the name of 'National Garden # 1'. In that sense, Suncheon Bay Garden is a must-see garden spot.

   Suncheon Bay Garden is recommended to visit along with Suncheon Bay Ecological Park located in the south. Admission tickets can also be used much cheaper by purchasing an integrated ticket than purchasing a separate ticket. In the case of the integrated ticket, Suncheon Bay Garden may not be ticketed due to the viewing time when entering the afternoon. Suncheon Bay Eco Park has been making reservations for 10,000 people a day starting April 1st. It is a good idea to make a reservation in advance to visit Suncheon Bay Eco Park, especially on weekends.

   The tree garden is a place where zelkova trees, hackberry trees, etc., which are commonly found in Korea, are gathered in one place. In particular, when you place your smartphone on the QR code attached to the tree, you can check the information of the tree, which literally acts as a picture book. The story of the trees that came to this place was varied as the Suncheon Bay Garden was established. The first pine tree moved to Suncheon Bay Garden, 'Garden of Earth's Garden No. 1', 'Ginkgo tree 5 minutes ago' which is almost cut off even after 5 minutes, and three ginkgo trees that have lived for more than 100 years after two lightning strikes. You can meet trees with storytelling such as “Eating Trees”.

   The path from the Korean garden to the Arboretum Observation Deck is uphill. When you reach the summit, you will see the Arboretum Observatory, where you can see Suncheon Bay Garden, and Azalea Garden. From the Arboretum Observatory, the magnificent ridges of Jirisan stretch from Suncheon Bay Garden to Gyeongsang-do from Jeolla-do. Azaleas usually remind of Sobaeksan, Hwangmaesan, and Jirisan Baraebong. It is not known that Suncheon is the hometown of azaleas where 70% of domestic azaleas are grown. In the azalea gardens along the slopes, red, pink and white azaleas boast bright colors. The azalea garden seen from the wetland center area is literally a flower garden.
