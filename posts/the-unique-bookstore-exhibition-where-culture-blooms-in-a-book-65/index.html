Not only that. The owner's seal is also generous. Present free coffee coupons to customers in various ways, including writing a booktail, selling a book, and posting it on social media. Points that can be earned in a variety of ways can be used like cash, from buying coffee to purchasing books to special lectures.

   If you're a bookworm, you might have heard the podcast ‘Red Bookstore’. In May 2012, Lee Dong-jin, a film critic, started as the main MC, and now has overwhelming No. 1 in the book category. Not only that. Thanks to its popularity, a cafe called 'red bookstore' was opened in front of the mecca of young people, Hongdae.

   Only sell limited edition! Your mind

  <div class="txt_p">
   Independent Publishing. This may be unfamiliar but good for people who like writing and for those who are thirsty for new books. Independent publications are books that are held in someone's arms through the help of one person from content creation to publication and distribution. Most of them are published at their own expense and do not have many copies. Instead, the preciousness doubles because it is a hard-to-find book. There are some books that aren't released, so it's like a limited edition.

   Your Mind is a bookstore that distributes these independent publications. Unlike other bookstores on the first floor, it is unique because it is easily accessible to people.

   The height of the floor is quite high, but the interior, which is designed like an attic, a bookshelf, a small stand, and a desk, is warm like my library. It's warmer because there are cats sitting on the cushions in front of the bar, picking their hairs and nodding them. Independent bookstores are as different from their uniform counterparts as their production. From handbook-sized pamphlets to thin magazines that are published occasionally, their shapes, designs, and content vary. So the fun is more diverse.
