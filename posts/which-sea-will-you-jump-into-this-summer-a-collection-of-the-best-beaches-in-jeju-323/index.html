    The weather is over 30 degrees, and it makes you realize that summer is approaching. When it's hot, jumping into the sea is the best way to go. Jeju Island where the slope is surrounded by the sea and you can meet the beach anywhere you go. It is the same island, but we collected Jeju's best beaches that attract tourists with different charms.

   This is Jeju's representative beach! Hamdeok vs Hyeopjae Beach
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    If you choose the representative beaches in Jeju, you can't miss Hamdeok Seowoobong and Hyeopjae Beach. Moreover, Hamdeok is located in the east and Hyeopjae in the west, and it is naturally a beach representing Jeju's east and west. Both attract a large number of visitors each year with clear, clean seas, beautiful scenery and well-equipped facilities.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Hamdeok Seowoobong Beach can be easily found from Jeju International Airport along the Ilju Road for 30-40 minutes east of Seongsan Ilchulbong. There are many amenities such as hotels, resorts, and restaurants around the beach, making it especially popular with families. In summer, it is crowded with outdoor tents and camping tents in various tents. You can even order food from the beach. During the high season, various festivals are held in addition to the opening of the night.

    However, the reason why Seowoobong Beach in Hamdeok is considered as a representative beach in the eastern part of Jeju is not because it is well equipped with amusement facilities. Above all, it is thanks to the beautiful natural scenery of the beach. The scenery created by the combination of several beaches created by the jagged coastline and Seowoobong towering at the end is not unusual. In addition, the trail to the summit of Seowoobong is well-maintained, so there are other things to enjoy besides sea bathing. There is no superb view of the beach looking up from here.

    Seongsegi Beach, Gimnyeong, about 10 minutes from Hamdeok, is another representative beach in the eastern region. It is famous for its white fine white sand like flour and has a relatively quiet and quiet atmosphere. You can make your own space on the large white sandy beach, and enjoy the leisurely tanning alone, listen to music, or read the audiences reading. Wind turbines standing at the end of the white sand and yachts floating near the shoreline add exotic flavor.

    Hyeopjae Beach, which represents the western part of Jeju, has well-equipped facilities as well as Hamdeok Seowoobong, attracting many visitors every year. Compared to Hamdeok, it is characterized by a wider distribution of guest houses and guest houses than large facilities such as hotels and resorts. So perhaps Hyeopjae has a lot of young tourists, and thanks to him, he has a more free and lively atmosphere. Of course, it is also suitable for family travelers. When the water is drained, the white sandy beach, which is widely exposed, is endless even if you go. The white sandy beach where water is splashed is a good playground for small children.

    Whatever it is, if it is Hyeopjae Beach, it is also Biyangdo. Biyangdo, which stands out in the middle of the sea, is a landscape that marks the beauty of Hyeopjae. Hyeopjae Beach without unreasonableness is unimaginable. Biyangdo, a small island created by a volcanic eruption tens of thousands of years ago, creates a fantasy for everyone who seeks Hyeopjae. It is an island of mystery that sometimes appears vividly and sometimes faintly like a mirage floating on the sea. It looks close enough to walk at low tide, but it takes about 15 minutes by boat from Hallim Port to get to Biyangdo. If you have time, you may want to plan a trip to Biyangdo Island. One or two hours is enough to tour Biyangdo. However, since there aren't many ships, you need to calculate time.
    <br/>
    The Geumneung Beach, a 5-minute walk from Hyeopjae, is also worth a visit. Unlike Hyeopjae, it feels small and cozy. It's not as beautiful as any beach, but it's even careful to soak your feet in the clear water that looks deep inside. Snorkeling at Geumneung Beach makes you forget about the heat of the summer and provides pleasant memories.

    Another enjoyment of summer beaches is water leisure sports. Jeju also has several beaches where you can enjoy snorkeling, scuba diving, surfing, and more. Among them, Jungmun Saekdal Beach and Sinyangseopjikoji Beach are the representative places. Jungmun Saekdal Beach in Jungmun Tourist Complex is famous for gathering surfers.

   There are many hotels and resorts nearby, so there are many tourists who come to the beach for bathing, but the waves are stronger than others, making it suitable for surfing.

    Shinyangseopjikoji Beach spreading near Seopjikoji can be seen by windsurfers on a windy day. The beach is formed in a wide semi-circular shape, so the waves are gentle even when the wind blows. Thanks to this, it is considered the best place for windsurfing. Windsurfers who swim freely around the waves cannot seem so envious. There are places where you can rent or teach windsurfing equipment on the beach, so even beginners can learn easily if they want to.

   Udo, an island in the island, has the Hongjo Dango Beach, famous for ‘Seobin Baeksa’, and another hidden beach, Hagosudong Beach. Designated as a natural monument, the red algae lump beach is a unique beach formed by shaving white hardened coral like coral after the death of lime algae called red algae. When the sun is shining, the beach glows white enough to shine. Unlike the fine white sand beach, the red algae on the soles of the feet are amazing.
