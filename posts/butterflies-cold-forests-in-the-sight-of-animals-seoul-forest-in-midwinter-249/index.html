    Winter cannot be crouched like a pupa in the room. Children's winter vacation has also started, and it is time for a full-fledged play program. When the cold wind blows, it goes to Seoul Forest. The Seoul Forest, which stands for the ecological forest in the city center, is not only the possession of gorgeous green and foliage. When you arrive through the cold, you will encounter a gentle and lively sight. In Seoul Forest, you can meet colorful butterflies, novel insects, and animals even in the middle of winter.

  <div class="txt_p">
   “Is it really cold, but do butterflies fly?”
   <br/>
   “Then, you can still see butterflies in winter.”
   <br/>
   The conversation between the mother and the child is interesting. Butterfly watching in the cold season is a strange reversal. There's another fun thing about smelting or mullet fishing through the ice.

   In winter, the Seoul forest is thin. Although the river breeze blows from the Han River, the open forest does not stop the bitter wind. Butterflies meet in a warm space with their hands tightly frozen.

    In Seoul Forest, the space where you can see butterflies is an insect botanical garden. Butterflies flying in the warm season of the butterfly garden move their nests to the interior of the 2nd floor of the Insect Botanical Garden. When you enter the Butterfly Eco Museum, which is open for free, you can meet the wings of swallowtail butterflies, wild swallowtail butterflies, and yellow butterflies. Butterflies become somewhat sluggish when the weather gets cold. Between 11 am and 2 pm during the day, a good sunshine time is when the butterfly is most active.

   Even if Dongjang-gun tries to ride, it is another spring in Butterfly Ecological Garden. The flowers are in full bloom and the temperature is quite high. If you're wearing a thick coat, sweat is on your forehead. If you look closely, you can observe the butterflies flying on the ceiling or the wall in the corner, in addition to the butterflies flying on the flowers. The process of hanging a rope on a board like a tightrope and turning a pupa into a butterfly is also revealed.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   “It's ugly now, but if you take off the pupa as if you wake up from a hibernation, it will become a colorful butterfly.”
   <br/>
   If the biological common sense that was usually told to the child is reproduced as it is in front of the eyes, understanding grows in one word. At the Butterfly Ecology Center, various events are held for Christmas lovers, such as flying butterflies and giving a butterfly sample event.

   Even if you go outside the ecological hall, there are plenty of interesting things to see. There is a separate butterfly exhibition hall where you can observe rare butterflies from all over the world, so you can learn the ecology of butterflies. In addition to butterflies, more than 100 species of insects inhabit the Insect Botanical Garden. You will encounter rare insects such as stag beetles, longevity scarabs, and double star crickets and giant spiders that you have only seen in books.

   Winter forest filled with cute fun
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    After walking out of the Insect Botanical Garden, we walk to the promenade with flower deer. Seoul Forest provides outdoor spaces where you can meet cute animals even in winter. In the 'House of Small Animals' next to the observation deck, you can see the cute and busy appearance of the guinea pigs. The experience of feeding deer directly from the deer cage is also fresh. There is a time to buy food at the field and feed the deer directly in the snow field. You will experience the fact that Seoul Forest is an ecological space where wild animals such as deer, elk and squirrel play. The experience of feeding deer with winter butterflies is an unforgettable memory for children.

   Roads that cross Seoul Forest like a maze are also good for winter walks. Among the 30 experience spaces, giant statues, etc. are transformed into hide-and-seek and slide-riding spaces in winter. The lawn, where cars and bicycles do not go, is filled with laughter from children who make snowmen and fight snow.

    First of all, it is necessary to recall the colorful modifiers attached to Seoul Forest.
   </p>
   <p>
    “If you have Central Park in New York and Hyde Park in London, there is Seoul Forest in Seoul.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Even near the place of life on a winter day, these informative and interesting experiences await. Seoul Forest is easily accessible by subway. After the Seoul Forest Station of the Bundang Line, it became possible to connect immediately without having to stay in the cold for a long time.
