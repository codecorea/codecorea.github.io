    It's fun to see the market even if there is no specific use. Fun to choose a variety of things, to taste a variety of food, and to see people. There is no end to the market views that have a lot of fun. Today, we are going to focus on ‘flavor’, which belongs to the ‘big fun’ of overflowing fun. As it is a representative market in Seoul, a variety of foods overflow. Introducing the more interesting Namdaemun &amp; Dongdaemun taste tour than the market. Let's take a look at Namdaemun Market.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Before going on a full-fledged market taste tour, let's take a moment to look at the history of the market. Namdaemun and Dongdaemun markets, where at first glance the buried years are buried, when did they start? To know the history of the market, you must go back to the Joseon Dynasty. The market for buying and selling goods began to grow rapidly in the late Joseon period, when the exchange of goods from the barter to the full-fledged monetary economy began.
    <br/>
   </p>
  </div>
  <strong class="ar_title">
   The more interesting the history of Namdaemun Market
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Along with the history of the market, modern and contemporary history of the land comes together. In the market where people, money, and products are gathered, the situation at that time remains as clear as “Nite”. The capital, Hanyang, was the center of the market as well as the administration. The luxury goods and daily necessities needed by the palaces and the yangban corps flow to the present Dongdaemun, Lee Hyun (actor) and Chil plaque market outside Namdaemun.
    <br/>
    The modern permanent market started in Seoul in the late 19th century, more than 100 years ago. At that time, the Ministry of Hanseong promoted a project to widen the road width by removing commercial temporary buildings lined up in Jongno and Namdaemun-ro. This temporary building was called a 'gaga (temporary building)'. The 'shop' comes from here. When the demolition of the small merchants' livelihoods are overwhelmed, the government gives them the warehouses of Namdaemun and Sunhyecheong. This is Namdaemun Market. But it didn't last long.
    <br/>
    In 1905, the Japanese imperialists took the diplomatic right of the Korean Empire with the “Korea-Japan Negotiation Treaty”. With this treaty, Korea becomes a Japanese colony. At that time, the Japanese who lived on the yolks of Chungmuro and Myeongdong must have caught sight of Namdaemun Market. When rumors circulated that the Ministry of Justice would take the Namdaemun market and hand it over to the Japanese, Korean traders who were struggling to find an alternative to create a new market on top of it covering the section from Gwangcheon (now Cheonggyecheon) Gwanggyo to the officers. From Gwanggyo to officers, it was named “Gwangjang Market” after the preceding letter. This is the story of Gwangjang Market, which we are looking for to eat 'Nokdubindaetteok' and 'Drug Kimbab'.

   Tour of Namdaemun Market starting at Exit 5 of Hoehyeon Station
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Chilpe Market outside Namdaemun in the late Joseon Dynasty was famous for the Nanjeon. Although it is slightly different from the current position of Namdaemun Market, it is usually regarded as the beginning of Namdaemun Market. Namdaemun Market in the 21st century is also close to Myeong-dong, making it a popular tourist course.
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   When you come out of Exit 5 of Hoehyeon Station, the stalls on the side of the street greet us. From the udon and noodles, there are plenty of food stalls to enjoy, such as fried giblets and bear eel. What to eat starts with the most exciting worries in the world. The huge Namdaemun market travel guide is not overlooked. This time, let's focus on ‘Taste’ to suit the purpose of ‘Marketing Tour’. The main street starts from Exit 5 of Hoehyeon Station. Around this large street is the Kalguksu Alley, which is considered as a delicacy of Namdaemun Market, and the Galchijorim Alley. In addition to this, the gomtang restaurant &lt;Eunho Restaurant&gt;, which has been in business for over 30 years, and &lt;chicken delicacy (formerly Gangwonjip)&gt;, which has a delicious taste of torn chicken, are added.

   The starting point of the tour is Kalguksu Alley. The name is ‘Kalguksu Alley’, but when you order the type of rice (barley rice, rice), it comes with kalguksu and cold noodles. Even if you order Kalguksu, cold noodles are served. The cold noodles are served in a small bowl, but the noodles are quite generous. Two women can fill their stomachs with just one order of barley rice.

   Eunho Restaurant is a gomtang specialty store that has been passed down for three generations since 1932 for over 80 years, and has a history of Namdaemun Market.
