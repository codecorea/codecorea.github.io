   In summer, is there anything more important than avoiding the heat? We prepared those who had poor physical strength to leave the fierce fierce sea to the mountains. Another vacation in the leisurely city center where everyone has left. Introducing the summer package.

    In fact, when I say 'hotel package', I am afraid to approach it. This month's salary prevents the previous month and dies vigorously in the 30s with a high Engel index. And he works to prevent the next month with his pockets that seem to fly again. I can't afford to take a vacation because of the money I think, and I'm worried about stopping next month.

   <p>
    Still, it's only a summer vacation once a year. For office workers, summer holidays are desert oasis and mirages. So I prepared. This summer, a summer hotel package that can relieve the stress of the past! Let's set off for a midsummer night's dream!
