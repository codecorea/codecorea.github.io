   Four seasons to see and eat Tongyeong. Perhaps the first thing that makes this Tongyeong trip even more special is his gem-like islands. The islands, which are scattered all the way to the far seas, including Hansan Island, Yongho Island, Bijin Island, Jangsa Island, Yeonhwa Island, Yeokdo Island, and Retail Road, embrace Tongyeong in the name of the tea ceremony. Hansando, which is only 30 minutes from Tongyeong, has the advantage of distance and the trail of Admiral Yi Sun-sin. Today, I decided to look back to Chubong Island, which connects Hansan and Yondo Bridge, for a more special trip to Hansan. 'Hansando' would be a different journey for those who only thought of 'General Yi Sun-sin' and 'Jeseungdang'.

   <p>
    Cars are essential to tour Hansan and Chubongdo. From Tongyeong Coast Passenger Terminal, ships depart for Hansando every hour from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm. Shipment is on-site, so it's a good idea to know your ship time and move diligently. Round trip fares cost 11,000 won for adults, 10,000 won for teenagers and 5500 won for children. The journey takes about 30 minutes. Medium-sized cars cost 28,800 won and vans cost 36,000 won. Vehicle shipping fee separately.
   </p>
   <p>
    Usually, the trip to Hansan Island ends with a visit to the Seongdang marina and a tour of the ruins of Lee Chungmugong. Not many people visit the Hansan Great Monument, which is 20 minutes away by car. But those who have run toward Chubongdo will know. It's too bad to have only traveled to Hansan Island after seeing the seungseongdang.
   </p>
   <p>
    Today's trip to Hansando is a course where you return to Cheongbongdo after returning to Cheongdang marina, Chubong bridge, Chuwon village, captive camp, Yegok village, Hansando land end village, Bongam Mongdol beach, Hansan Grand Memorial Monument, Jeseungdang, and Jeseungdang dock. First, we will return to Cheongbongdo Island and then return to Hansan Island to see the Hansan Grand Monument Monument and the Seongdangdang.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Chubongdo Island, a little unfamiliar name, is a neighboring island to the southwest of Hansan Island. With the addition of Chubong Bridge in 2007, it was possible to travel to Hansando and Yeondo Bridge. The name Chubong-do is named after the first letters of Chuwon and Bong-am, the largest of his four villages. Get off at the Cheongdang marina and turn right. Turn left to get on the driveway. If you run along the outskirts of the island, you will encounter the salt flats of Daegopo Village. The first tidal flat in Hansando was the salt flat that General Yi Sun-shin baked salt for military supplies during the Imjin War. Now it is divided into Daego and Sogo. It looks more elegant thanks to the cloudy weather.

The sign says, 'This is the village of Ipjeongpo, and the flower bonus has floated down here because the poor young filial young man who cried for his mother's funeral was not crying.' The name 'Saengyi Island' comes from the dialect of 'Bonus'. Again, it looks like a flower bonus.

   Let's take a look at Hansan Daejeon. In 1592 (25th year of the ancestors), about 70 ships docked at the endurance of narrow waterway between Tongyeong and Geoje. Admiral Yi Sun-sin attacked the Korean soldiers as if they were running away and induces them to come off the Hansan coast. When the chasing troops come off the coast of Hansan Island, Chung Mu Gong orders a counterattack. The tactic used at this time is the famous ‘학익진’. As the name suggests, Hak is a tactic of attacking the enemy with a winged wing and requires a high level of skill and training. The result is a big win. With the victory of the Hansan Daejeon, the Korean Navy captures the maritime rights of the South Seas.
