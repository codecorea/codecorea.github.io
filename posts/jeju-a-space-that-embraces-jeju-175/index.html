    There is a lot of space in Jeju, where deep forest shades and translucent seas rush even if you are just outside the city. It is a house facing the ascent, as well as a cafe lined by the coast, and architects and artists took their place early and speared through the window to shine the wind and light.
    <br/>
    The same is true of the Gidang Museum of Art, Korea's first museum of art. The Gidang Museum of Art has entered the hillside of Seogwipo City, overlooking Mt. Halla. The building was built and donated by Kang Gum-beom, a businessman from Japan, a businessman from Japan, and celebrated his 30th anniversary last year.

Null is a Jeju dialect of a pile of piled grains piled up in rounds. The outer wall was finished with Jeju basalt so that it could harmonize well with the surroundings.

    When you step inside, the rafters exposed radially are impressive. The sunlight and clouds of Jeju rush into the skylights facing the sky. When you walk along the floor drawing spirals, the canvas containing Jeju unfolds one after another. The main writer is a change artist who describes the violent winds of Jeju well and is called a “storm painter”. He is buried in black on an ocher background, showing everything in Jeju landscape. In particular, in the works left behind in the hometown of Jeju in the late 1970s, the sea, thatched houses, crows, sailboats, horses, and stone walls can be found mainly.

    If the Gidang Museum of Art embraced Halla Mountain, the Walljong Museum of Art draws the sea off the coast of Seogwipo. The Woljong Museum of Art, opened in 2013 near Jeongbang Falls, is home to the dreams of Lee Walljong. The building was built in the form of a soft white porcelain mug according to the artist's concept. It was a collaborative work between Swiss architect David Merculo and Korean architect 10,000 Won, which took only two years to design.
    <br/>
    Waljong Museum of Art is characterized by making a lot of windows so that the sunlight spreads evenly. Through the glass, the sea off the coast of Seogwipo glances at a glance. This is because even the height of the window frame is picked one by one so as not to be uncomfortable.

    In the exhibition room, there are about 100 works of this artist, including paintings, reliefs, wood, and ceramics. Birds, flowers, roe deer, dogs, horses, and bright canvases that people play together go well with the sunny space.
    <br/>
    At the rooftop garden, you can meet the warm scenery of Chekseom and Munseom floating in the sea. It is clear when it is clear and cloudy when it is cloudy. If you take a step back and put your gaze toward the sea, the horizon will overflow over the curved outer wall. In the late afternoon, the sea turns to honey color, and its appearance is reminiscent of black tea in a similar mug. If you raise your head to the sky, a stone statue sitting on the watchtower will catch your eye. This work was known as a self-portrait modeled by Lee Wall-jong. On the floor beneath the watchtower, various shapes of pottery works are scattered on each side as if covering a statue.

    In the sea off the coast of Seogwipo, there is also “Sora's Castle,” which is meaningful in architectural history. The castle of Sora is believed to be the work of Kim Joong-up, a master of modern Korean architecture. In December 1969, it was built two stories above the ground. Officially, it is ‘unknown by the author’, but it is considered to be the work of Kim Jung-up, or at least strongly influenced by his design techniques and features.
    <br/>
    You can meet the castle of Sora by going along the Olle 6 course and heading towards a certain Bangpokpo. Standing crouching on a coastal cliff reminds me of a snail going to the sea. Above all, four pillars made with the beauty of the curve are impressive. On the surface, the mongdol from Jeju sea is closely packed to make a perfect harmony with the building.

    As you climb up the rooftop along the staircase, the vast sea rushes. The staircase draws a gentle spiral and goes through the second floor to the rooftop, but the passage is narrow and dark, making it feel as if you are going into a conch. The building was used as an observatory, restaurant, etc., and was included in the disaster risk zone in 2003, leaving it empty for some time. Later, Seogwipo City purchased buildings and surrounding land, and was used as an information center for Jeju Olle Trail from April 2009 until recently. Currently, it is being used as a book cafe after repair and reinforcement work. Few books are available, but there are quite a variety of books, including travel, essays, novels, and fairy tales. Coffee is free.

    The other building of Kim Joong-up, who remains in Jeju, is the building of the Faculty of Fisheries, the College of Agriculture, Jeju National University. In 1971, it is now used as Seogwi Jungang Girls' Middle School. Buildings have different appearances depending on the viewing direction, so you cannot predict the other side by looking at only one side. Apparently, the first thing that catches your eye is the western side. The light-shielding film with windows is unique to prevent direct sunlight or rainwater from entering.

    Jeju also has a number of sensuous spaces that are touched by world-class architects. The well-known architects, Tadao Ando and Itami Jun, Swiss architect Mario Bota, and Mexican architecture master Ricardo Legoretta have created and filled the space with Jeju's beautiful nature. The prominent architect is far from safe. One of the most famous art museums in Jeju, the Bontae Museum, Yumin Museum of Art, and Glass House all came from his fingertips.

    The Bontae Museum was located on the slopes of the foot of Hallasan in Andeok-myeon. The original form (本 態) means the original form and essence, and contains the meaning of exploring the fundamental beauty of man. The exhibition covers the most Korean and the most modern, from embroidery crafts to works by Yayoi Kusama. According to the purpose of the museum's establishment, Ando was contemplating a way to adapt to the land of Jeju and to incorporate Korean tradition and modernity. He designed the building so that it did not deliberately set the ground, but naturally harmonized with the surrounding landscape. At the center, there is a traditional fence of Jeju, and a stream flows along the side to create nature. White rice is a mountain defense mountain seen in Asrai based on the blank space. Sanbangsan, which floats between buildings and over waterways, is beautiful, but it is like a mirage that cannot be grasped.

    Yumin Museum of Art and Glass House have entered the outstanding scenery of Seopjikoji. If the glass house protrudes over the tip of the cape and overwhelms nature, the Yumin Museum of Art dwells under the ground and humbly accepts nature.
    <br/>
    Yumin Museum of Art was operated as a meditation center “Genius Rossay” and opened in June last year. When you enter the entrance, stone gardens appear on both sides of the road, and the path of water spreads quietly through the garden of wind, where the silver grass winds in the wind. As the sound of water fade, the chakyeong encountered at the end of the road is intense. Seongsan Ilchulbong is trapped in a long window around a stone wall like a picture. On a windless day, it is difficult to imagine where it is from outside and where it is inside.

    The glass house is a V-shaped building that rises above the ground. From the front, it also seems to stretch towards the sea. The building was built toward Jeong Dong-hyang. In the center, a windy path was laid, and in the front, a rhombic flowerbed was created. The first floor is the Zippo Museum, and the second floor is the restaurant. At the restaurant, you can see Seongsan Ilchulbong and Gwangchigi Beach at a glance.

    Seogwipo is also a city of Muhyang. It is also in Seogwipo, where the best calligraphy artist of late Joseon Dynasty, Kim Jeong-hee, completed the Chusa font, and the master of Soam Hyeonjunghwa, a master of the 20th-century Korean West, wrote to the end of his life.
    <br/>
    The Jeju Officer entered Daejeong-eup, Seogwipo-si, where Kim Jeong-hee lived. The building was built of wood, modeled after Chusa's masterpiece, Sehando (National Treasure No. 180). Sehando is a painting sent to the ideal student, the disciple who saved a precious book. The canvas, which consists of a few pine and pine trees in one shabby house, is desolate and lonely. A tree standing firmly in the cold stands for an ideal character that kept its loyalty even in long exile.

    Seung Hyo-sang is the architect who brought Chusa's work into the landscape of Jeju. Like Hyo-sang's character, Seung Hyo-sang finished the painting with a round window with a clean and clean appearance, and planted pine trees straight on the sides. At the entrance, there was a staircase to go to reproduce the rough journey of Chusa. Most of the exhibition halls are placed underground, but there is no frustrating feeling due to natural light pouring through the high ceilings and glass wall windows.
    <br/>
    In the exhibition hall, you can look into the curved side of Chusa through various exhibits. The best thing to see is his writing. In his majestic typeface, his life as well as his studies are melted. In addition, you can appreciate a letter written by acquaintances in order to soothe the loneliness of an exile during the exile period, as well as one of the three limits that Chikashi Fujitsuka, a Japanese Chusa researcher.

    If you go upstairs after looking around Chusa's works and table books, it is Chusa Hall. In the empty space, only the bust of Chusa, created by Im Ok-sang's artist, is lying. The extremely understated space gives an intense and deep aftertaste.
    <br/>
    When you come out of the exhibition hall, it is a Chuseok beggar. The house where Chusa lived and the life of exile were restored. The street he was staying in was a cramped room about a pyeong. He completed Chusa-cheok here, drew many paintings including Sehan-do, and left many achievements such as teaching scholars and calligraphy to Jeju's larvae.

    Soam Memorial Hall is a space where calligraphy from Seogwipo commemorates Soam Joonghwa. Soam, who studied at Waseda University in Japan, draws a clear stroke in the modern modern western world of Korea after working on the western Japan.
    <br/>
    The memorial was built with Jo Beom Sanbang, where Soam lived and lived. Jo Beom Sanbang (眺 帆 山房) means ‘the house overlooking the sailboat’. Soam sat here, fluttering a long beard and did not stop brushing until the paper touched the ceiling. Very rarely, I ate, slept, and wrote only, except for outside access. Soam's stroke resembles Jeju through the window. It is beautiful, but it is bizarre, soft, and changeless. Each point, one stroke, the sea and wind of Jeju stand out.
