   Painting murals are well peeled off by rain and wind and may look heterogeneous, so I chose achromatic metal as a material. In his mind, Nam wanted to make a mural that penetrated the landscape naturally. The village secretariat and the Rural Development Corporation were persuaded for nine months to complete the “Trouble Road Project. As a result, 34 works embroidered the village from the end of October to mid-December 2014.

   12 artists participated in the project. It was recruited through SNS, and was introduced to the artist by knowing through school seniors and juniors. Gimnyeong is a seaside village, and its works are mostly made of copper rather than iron because the works can be quickly destroyed by the influence of sea breeze and seawater. “Iron is corroded, but copper is colored. The color changes nicely with sea breeze and sea water. As time goes by, the work gets more and more valuable. ” Representative Nam

   Leave the project again and walk near the sea. On a wall, we discover Chu-sky's work, Island Kid. It is a work that expresses the strong mother and haenyeo of Jeju.

   She stands in front of the haenyeo who goes well with the orange roof. When I look closely at the net that Haenyeo has rescued, it is a flower that bloomed in a lump. Kim Sun-young's &lt;Blossom Wave&gt; expresses that the flowers they have rescued for the rest of their lives are flowers, and their flower-like youth. Lee Hyun-jung's &lt;Cantabile&gt;, which means that fish are harmonized in the life of a haenyeo according to the sound of the sea, is as beautiful as a soft coastline. After this piece, the grandfather is drying up the starfish in the courtyard of an old house. I lived in this village for a lifetime and was bored.

   There are many works that portray Haenyeo, but it is a different feeling when faced with garlic artist 'Wonder HaeNyeo'. I wanted to break down the prejudice against the female divers by expressing the female divers as a wonder woman. “I think Haenyeo is a person who is doing hard work. Especially, women in Gimnyeong are strong, blunt and clunky. Because the land was so poor that I had to make material, and because of the wind and the sound of the waves, I was short and thick when I spoke. The girls and girls I met face to face with exciting music, fun work, and warmth for strangers. I wanted to express it cheerfully that the women were forced to be strong. ”
