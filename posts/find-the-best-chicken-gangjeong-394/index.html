   Chicken season is approaching. It is delicious to eat at all times of the season, but it will be thanks to Boshinyong Samgyetang that more people are looking for chicken on a hot day. Ginseng and jujube, various medicinal ingredients, and a bowl of samgyetang boiled with glutinous rice, and the food you've seen in the summer are nothing like this. But where is the only chicken dish? Even chicken that is loved throughout the four seasons is not as diverse as seasoning chicken, garlic chicken, and liver chicken. You can't miss out on the dark horse chicken gangsters that are rapidly rising.

   Chicken Gangjeong, reveal the identity!

  <div class="txt_p">
   Chicken Gangjeong. A delicacy that adds sweet and spicy sauce to fried chicken. Peanuts or nuts are added to add savory flavor, and polka dots are added to emphasize the spiciness. In many ways, it is similar to seasoned chicken. But why did they name it “chicken gangjeong”? It looks similar, but once you taste it, you can tell the difference. Chicken Gangjeong, coated with malt once, has a crispy texture for a relatively long time. These days, it's not very common for the seasoning chicken to be so good that the technology has improved, but it might have been a quirky technology when it appeared like a comet after an electric roasted chicken.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   'Gangjeong' is a precious food that went up to the feast and rituals along with medicine and tea ceremony. After drying the glutinous rice flour, slice it, fry it in oil, and smear it with honey and poached rice to form a Gangjeong. Once you see the process of making Gangjeong, it becomes easy to understand why 'Gangjeong' is attached to chicken Gangjeong. This is because the process of frying chicken in oil and burying the seasoning sauce mixed with honey and malt is the same as 'Gangjeong'. The sauce with starch syrup prevented it from getting wet by wearing thin clothes on the tempura, and thanks to this, people could taste chicken gangjeong that has not changed over time. That's why there are a lot of people looking for chicken gangjeong.

   Sinpo International Market is located in Sinpo-dong, Jung-gu, Incheon. Take Exit 2 of Dongincheon Station on Subway Line 1, and walk about 300m to reach it. Those who visit the market with their own vehicles can use nearby public parking lots.

   Inside, not only chicken gangjeong, but also a variety of foods such as Chinese gonggal bread, dumplings, minced sashimi, spicy noodles, and sundae make people excited about the market. Not only that. Outside the market, the modern and contemporary history of Korea continues to be carved into pieces along the Gaehang Nuri-gil to Chinatown. Food and stories along the chicken gangjeong bite the tail. You can eat as much as you like and walk along the way, and get an unexpected history study.

   When you arrive at the market, go to the Sinpo International Market Support Center. The market is not very large, but a brochure with market maps and history is quite useful. Let's meet the main character, Chicken Gangjeong. It is located at the entrance of the first alley near Dongincheon Station. It is said that the spicy smell is the chicken gangjeong alley. The chicken alley is not bigger than I thought. Some chicken gangjeong houses can be seen around &lt;Sinpo Chicken Gangjeong&gt;, but they are not as active as Sokcho Tourist Fish Market. However, when people gather and make long lines, it turns into an alley without chickens. It is a good idea to remember that the line of packing and the line of entering the restaurant (the line of eating and eating) are different in preparation for joining this line someday.

I don't know how spicy it is, and I dip it in the sauce and eat it again. It should be said that it is a spicy taste that comforts modern people suffering from various stressful worlds as it has become abundant. Indeed, there is a chicken gangjeong alley on the line across the street from &lt;Shinpo Chicken Gangjeong&gt;. Wouldn't it be fun to compare tastes?

   Now that you've tasted the chicken you want, let's take a look around the market to digest it. Vegetable fried chicken and fish cake, which are as famous as chicken gangjeong, also attract customers. Despite the excitement of various tastes, the taste of China, which spreads all over the market such as gonggalppang and dumplings, stands out. Chinatown is on the verge of something, and it will have something to do with China. It is said that Chinese sailors enjoyed the chicken gang just tasted.

   The old place name of Sinpo-dong, where the Sinpo International Market is located, is ‘Tojingae’. A bursting stream? Is it a burst? If you pronounce the place name, you can see that this was a village that naturally exploded towards the water's edge (sea). In fact, the market and Incheon Port are not far. It is a stop only to Chinatown, where you can reach Freedom Park, where Incheon Port opens at a glance. It is a distance that is not difficult to reach even on foot. General MacArthur, who conducted the Incheon Landing Operation, remains in Incheon Freedom Park here as a statue. Between these two, 'Gaehangnurigil' is located.

   Let's take a look at the history of old Incheon as we climbed the opening of the port. The old place name in the Incheon area is Michu Hall. History records this town as a failed town of Biryuk Baekje and a barren land in which salty waters dig deep. However, in 1883, Incheon was reborn as a gateway to the West Sea when it was selected as the “open port” to handle the bombing of modernization. People carried things along with them. In particular, many came from Shandong, China, which was geographically close to Incheon. Just looking at the phrase ‘I can hear the chicken crying in Shandong Province’ in our old literature, we can see that the Korean Peninsula and Shandong Province were quite close. They worked to carry the luggage of the ships carrying them to Incheon Port and made “Jjajangmien” and ate it. We added “Caramel” to it to make our own Jjajangmyeon. When you go to Chinatown, the first Chinese restaurant "Gonghwachun" on earth turns into a jajangmyeon museum to greet travelers.

   When they get to a certain degree, the natural “merchant” Chinese begin their business. The foundation is seen as the predecessor of Fuseong Guijeon in Sinpo-dong and Sinpo International Market. As the name suggests, the seeds were taken from their hometown, Shandong Province, where they sold vegetables and farmed themselves. The main customer was Japanese. It started with Fusheng Return, but the sea was close, so the fish market would have been added. In the saying, “If you are not in the Shinpo market, you can't get anywhere,” you can guess the market in its heyday. This is the story of Gonggal bread and dumplings that we now taste at Sinpo International Market. The empty white bread and the filling dumplings may not symbolize the rise and fall of Sinpo International Market. If you can afford it, walk to Chinatown. The night view of Incheon Port from Freedom Park is also a good date course.

Of these, Abai Sundae is a chicken alley where several restaurants form an alley. You can see the entrance of Abai Sundae Town on the road near the main entrance of Sokcho Tourist Fish Market. It is a space where you can taste North Korean food with Abai Village in Cheongho-dong, not far away. I am curious in this passage. Why did you taste Abai Sundae in Sokcho?

   To find this, we must go back to the Korean War. On June 25, 1950, the beautiful Mt. Geumsugang begins to turn into blood. The superficial reason is the conflict of ideology. The Korean people are divided into South and North as avatars of the great powers to fight the war. At the end of the war, during the 1/4 retreat, the residents of Hamgyeong-do, who had fled with the South Korean army, stopped here in Sokcho. You might not be far away thinking about going back to your homeland soon. The homeland, which knew that it was going to return soon, was blocked by the truce and was unable to promise a reunion. When they became displaced people, they made the food they ate in their hometown and ate them. There would have been no other way.

   Cheongho-dong, which stayed for a while, becomes the second home of displaced people. In the village, the sound of 'Abai', which means 'grandfather' and 'uncle', became 'Abai village'. Their North Korean food made with their longing and sulwoom made this a unique tourist destination, and people flocked. There are restaurants specializing in North Korean food such as &lt;Dancheon Restaurant&gt;. It's a trip to cool off your head, but why is the food here not just staying ‘delicious’? As mentioned earlier, remember that you can taste authentic North Korean food not only in Abai village but also in Abai Sundae Town, which is located in Sokcho Tourist and Fisheries Market. Sokcho Tourism and Fisheries Market is big and the story of Sokcho is overflowing with only the taste of chicken Gangjeong.
