   Convenient for traveling by subway or city in front of Gwangju Songjeong Station
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Before the West Coast Highway was completed in 2001, it was convenient for tourists in the metropolitan area to use the Honam Highway Mine Tollgate to travel to Honam provinces such as Mokpo, Yeongam, and Naju. Since then, the emergence of the Gochang-Damyang Expressway followed the emergence of the West Coast Expressway, making the name “mining” faint in tourists' heads. Then, with the recent opening of the Honam Line KTX, the mining district with Gwangju Songjeong Station was revived as a hot topic. Local residents expect that the number of visitors to Gwangju Songjeong Station will increase from 4,000 on average to 12,000.

   The name 'Gwangsan-gu' was born in 1988 when Songjeong and Mining County were incorporated into Gwangju. Of the five districts that make up Gwangju, the area occupies 222.9㎢ (44.05%), the largest. There is a subway station with the same name right in front of the new station of Gwangju Songjeong Station. The subway in Gwangju runs between Okdong Station, Gwangju Songjeong Station, Gwangju Airport, Kimdaejung Convention Center, Geumnam-ro, Culture Hall, Hakdong and Jeungsimsa Entrance, and Yongsan Vehicle Station. Foreign travelers can take the Honam Line KTX and get off at Gwangju Songjeong Station and transfer to the subway for easy transportation around Gwangju.

   Yong-A Park Enjoys Literary Journey at Birthplace
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   One of the most popular tourist attractions near Gwangju Songjeong Station in Gwangsan-gu is Yonga birthplace. 'Yong-ah' is a child of Park Yong-cheol (1904 ~ 1938) who worked as a poet during the Japanese occupation. Born in Gwangsan-gu, he worked with Young-Rang Kim and Jung Ji-yong to publish Literary Literature. The poet published his leading works, Leaving Boats and Sending You in the Night Train, in The First of Poetry Literature. Here's a look at his poem Leaving Ship. The specialty is engraved on the granite fertilization of the flower bed of the dragon child.

   It is probably because of the song of singer Kim Soo-chul that this poem comes close to us. Kim Soo-cheol quotes a part of the poet Park Yong-chul's poems in the song &lt;Go To Me Too&gt;. The desire to leave younger ages with tears and to find a dream was the independence of the country for the poet Park Yong-chul, and for the singer Kim Soo-chul. Even though the direction is different according to the times, the value is still so many people love their words and lyrics.

   Unspoken conversations with poets
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Let's follow Yonga Park's literary life a little longer. He also published Literary Monthly and Literature, and translated and introduced foreign poems and plays. He also worked as a literary critic, but unfortunately he died in his mid-30s. The cause of death was tuberculosis. In addition to his birthplace, his fertilization, which engraves Leaving Boat, is also set up on the slope of Yangji, which leads to Songjeong Park.
   <br/>
   The poet's birthplace is surrounded by stone walls cleared with ocher. It is a thatched house with a wide yard, flower bed, and jangdokdae. Perhaps because of his literary activities with Jung Ji-yong and Kim Young-rang, looking at every corner of his birthplace naturally reminds him of poems such as &lt;Perfume&gt; and Kim Young-rang's &lt;Sunshine on a Stone Wall&gt;.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Another thing that catches your eye is the large paintbrush that painted the faces of six poets. It was used in the Yonga Literary Festival in 2014, and there is even a paint board in the yard, so it is less lively. Poetry poets such as Kim Yun-sik, Jung In-bo, Byun Young-ro, Jung Yong-yong, Park Yong-cheol, and Lee Ha-yun bloomed like flower wine. Their footprints can also be found in the Museum of Literature and Literature (opened in 2012) in Gangjin-eup, Gangjin-gun. Kang Jin is the birthplace of Kim Young Rang. Leaving Yong-Ah's birthplace, I recall Park Yong-chul's other representative film, Sending You to the Night Train.

   Learned from Wolbongseowon, the high peak
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The footsteps of travelers who enjoyed literary journeys lead to exploration of their vows. Wolbongseowon, located in Gwangsan-gu, Gwangsan-gu, is quite old-fashioned from the way from the parking lot to the entrance of Seowon. This is because a low dirt wall, neatly tiled, passes through a village road. Wolbongseowon was founded in 1578, after the death of the teacher. It is now considered one of the eight scenes of Gwangju.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Gobong is famous as a scholar who exchanged the theory with Toegye Lee Hwang. The main auditorium of Seowon is called Bingwoldang. Chungjo bought Gobong's noble school virtues and gave the title of ‘Bingsim Snowwall’. The kindly reading of the jury with the Korean translation kindly adds to the enjoyment of the vow. The book begins with ‘Get a book and find a teacher and rise to a high hermit, 'and ends the middle section with‘ What will be lamented later divided into dragons and pigs? ’. 'Strive today' contains lessons.
   <br/>
   “The foundation of the state is to make the people at ease. Only after the people are comfortable can enlightenment be made. It must be taught after the people have been strengthened first, and the people have been made rich. ”

  <div class="txt_p">
   Sinchang-dong ruins (Historic No. 375) may be disappointed because it is a field with no streets and no museums. However, according to the description of the Gwangju National Museum, there are many relics such as earthenware, wood, keel, and lacquerware that give a glimpse of the agricultural culture of the first century BC. Imagine the days when there would be no driveways or apartment complexes, and you can imagine that people were a very good place to live in groups. In particular, Shin Chang-dong was nicknamed the 'Ancient Textile Factory' in that the oldest silk and burlap relics in Korea, bodies, thread bobbins and bone needles needed to produce these fabrics were excavated. In the main hall on the first floor of the Gwangju National Museum, a special exhibition will be held until May 25, 'The Silk Country, Textile Culture of Sinchang-dong, Gwangju'.
