   Tongyeong, a beautiful port city in the South Sea of Hallyeosu Island. The scent of culture and art, as well as the land spreading gently, is a jewel-like island scattered in the Tongyeong Sea.

   Apparently, the retail price was 'island in fairy tales'. The retail road that was headed to a winter alone in the middle of the twenties was a pretty and Jericho island. Thanks to me, I used to think of it like my first love. Then, after about 10 years, “I still wondered, how did it change?” With a little bit of anticipation and excitement, the retail road that I found again was not a cute island, but a mountain. The body that has become heavy over the years has also played a role, but the retail product was not just the “small and beautiful island” that appeared in the confectionary CF.
   <br/>
   It seems that the 'biasedness' about retail sales wasn't the only reporter. At first glance, I see beautiful women wearing high shoes that are sure to be new sandals. Pretty, but like any other island in the vast sea, comfortable shoes are a must to look around in the sleeves of 'Dolsan'.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Myeongdo Island is composed of three islands: Daemaemuldo, Retail Muldo, and Lighthouse Island. Among them, the retail waterway and the lighthouse island meet each other, making a path over the sea twice or twice a day. Located in the middle of the sea, the two islands facing each other as if they depended on each other boast excellent scenery thanks to the heavy waves and the rocks depicted by the wind. This is the reason why many people are looking for retail goods among the numerous islands that have filled the sea and the sea of Tongyeong, such as Hansando, Chubongdo, Yokjido, and Bijindo.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   To go to the retail waterway, you have to take a boat at the Tongyeong Passenger Ship Terminal. Departs three times daily (06:50, 10:50, 14:30). Departures increase during peak season or weekends. Also, it is flexible depending on the weather and passenger situation, so it is better to check in advance. Especially during the summer vacation, the weather fluctuates depending on the weather, so check it again and again.

   If you've solved both, start immediately. The road to Lighthouse Island leads to steep stone steps and wooden decks that run through the village. As the island rises in the middle of the sea, there is no way to go uphill. There is a shade that rests in the middle, so you can walk slowly.

   If you find a retail waterway, cross the Lighthouse Island, which you will never miss. The retail island and the lighthouse island are about 80m away, but at low tide twice a day, a small “miracle of Moses” occurs between them. Mongdol Beach, also known as 'Yeolmokgae Gravel Road', is exposed above the sea. If you match the boat time and tide time, you can have a “special experience” that crosses the Mongdol towering over the sea and crosses the lighthouse island and retail waterway.

In this way, it took enough time for the retail to pass from the pier to Mangtaebong to Lighthouse Island. It is time to add photos. Adding up to the time to go back again is enough for about 4 hours round trip. If you come in the first boat (6:50 AM) from the Tongyeong Passenger Ship Terminal and go out to the last boat (4:30 PM), there is no reason to wander around the island.
