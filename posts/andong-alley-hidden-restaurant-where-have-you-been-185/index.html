   When planning a trip, searching for restaurants is a must-have course. When you search for Andong restaurants, Andong jjimdak in the old market jjimdak alley appears first, and the Andong Dam Wolyeonggyo traditional food street, the famous ‘Gakjipjipji’, and the Andong Ganjeok that can be found anywhere in Andong. In search, I asked the natives of Andong, who weren't in the castle, a hidden restaurant that was verified by history, tradition, and taste in addition to Andong's three major delicacies.

   If you go in front of Andong Station, there is Andong Ribs Alley. Thirty years ago, it started with one or two ribs, not to mention ribs, but it has been growing one by one, and 15 ribs are now in business. Andong-style seasoned ribs are soy sauce seasoned with fresh garlic and fruit juice, and are served at the same time as the order, so you have to use good ribs. So, of course, it is fresh and delicious.

   After eating the charcoal-grilled ribs, you can enjoy the spicy rib stew and spicy rib stew. It's best cooked on a charcoal fire and cooked with spicy ribs after removing the meat on a rib that can't be burned or chewy. Even if you choose chewy ribs and eat the rice with the remaining seasoning, it is also delicious. The miso stew, boiled with soybean paste soaked in the countryside, is delicious when eaten with a soft, savory siraegi on rice, and when you eat a cool soup, the feeling of ribs disappears. It is enough to eat 2 servings of 3 people because it is 200g to the bones per serving.

   Okya Restaurant, located in Anjak Alley, in Andong New Market, is a restaurant that has been boiling Seonjiguk Rice for 50 years. Until it is highly praised by the national rice enthusiasts as the best soup in the country, the broth of Okya Restaurant is boiled constantly, with plenty of Andong Hanwoo's noodles such as Yangji, Satae, and Seonji. The visual is rich in beef, spicy red pepper oil, sweet radish, and green onions, but it's a simple name, Seonjigukbap. The trade name “Andong Siyeonghalmae Sunjik Gukbap” used the sign of a municipal butcher operated by Okya Restaurant. As I was at a meat store, I was able to boil soup with a lot of delicious meat.

   Add a pot full of Andong Korean beef bones and meat, and simmer the cabbage, green onion, and sesame seeds in savory broth. The shop, which started with one square, continues to expand to the side, but the waiting time becomes longer in winter. The shabby interior where the traces of the old buildings remain are in harmony with the taste of a bowl of soup. Adding soup, meat and rice is unlimited. A combination of illusion that makes the bowl of soup cooked every day, sour mixed, and red bean paste pickled in a bowl.

   Rumors are good, but the most difficult food to eat is Andong Geonjin Noodles. In Andong city, there are several noodle shops that serve dried noodles, but if you go to 'Park Jae-sook Farmer's House' on the way to Hahoe Village, you can taste the dried noodles. In a traditional way, the dough mixed with flour and soy flour is pushed with red sesame seeds, boiled in boiling water, dried, and then dried. Konjin noodles are perfect for summer, but they are always a favorite for those who like noodles.

   The owner puts anchovy, radish, onion, and kelp into the seaweed twice a week to boil the broth with care. The pumpkin, kimchi, grated flour, and sesame seeds are gently softened, and the soft noodles are soft. It feels plain, but the soup is so deep that it is impossible to give up the last melody.
