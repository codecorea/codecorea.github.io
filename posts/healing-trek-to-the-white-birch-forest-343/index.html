    In winter, there is a brighter landscape. A scene like “Winter Fairy Tale” depicted by trees that stretch out with white snow and dazzling white flesh in them. You may have come across a movie in the background of a cold country. The immaculate trees filled with such white snow provided a vivid and familiar winter image for us born and raised on this earth. Furthermore, naturally, it made me think, 'I want to see this winter scenery someday.' Unfortunately, it is not easy to see trees with such white skin on the earth.

    The identity of the snow that makes the snow glow is a birch. If you look at him with a bright, shiny white tree trunk that grows up to 20 meters, it seems that you faced 'Eom Chin-ah' with a perfect expression from head to toe. First of all, it looks great. The body is stretched without knowing the sky high. And fine (white) skin. It will fold a number in appearance. (Like a handsome man) What if it's useless? It's just a good thing to see. But this is not all. Oak Tree A member of the birch family 'Birch' is a useful plant in many ways.

    Birch, as hard as birch, is great for making furniture. The white and shiny shell was well-fired and was useful as a fire fighter. The name birch is also said to be burning with the sound of 'birch'. In addition, his epidermis, which is thinly peeled off like paper, was used to draw or write on paper as a substitute. A part of Hapyeong Haeinsa's Palmman Daejanggyeong was also known as birch, and the material of Cheonmado, which decorated the horse saddle of Cheonmachong in Gyeongju, is also a birch bark. Even now, there were no birch trees in Silla's royal road, Gyeongju. Where did this birch come from?

    If you look at this, you can see one thing. Birch trees grow in cold places. There are also birch communities in Korea. Most of them are located in the mountainous regions of the north of the central part. In South Korea, they can be seen in the mountainous regions of Gangwon-do such as Taebaek, Hoengseong and Inje. Among them, Inje is regarded as a representative birch colony.

   There are two known birch trees in Inje. One is located in Susan-ri at the foot of Eungbong-san and the other is located in Wondae-ri. Although Susan-ri is a colony with a little more birch trees, this time we decided to look at Wondae-ri, which is easier to find.

   Confess before going on a full-scale trek. The entrance to the Birch Forest in Wondaeri is controlled during the forest fire period (February 1 to May 15, November 1 to December 15). The period of viewing the picturesque birch forest in the white snow is 45 days from December 16 to January 31. This means that you must wait until December to see the winter landscape of Wondari Birch Forest.

    Wondae-ri birch forest is located at '75 -22 Won-dae-ri '. The road is not difficult. You can start with 'Wondaeri Forest Monitoring Post'. After making a guestbook at the guard post, it goes up along the forest road of about 3.5km. The path that runs smoothly along the hillside is a path that can be easily walked by both men and women. But if you visit here in winter, spats and crampons are a must. There are many people looking for, but it is a snowy road that has been compacted by people's footprints, but it is much easier to focus on trekking in case the cold snow will wet your instep.

    The further away from the entrance faced by the province, the quieter. Birch trees that reveal white flesh like white flesh begin to appear one by one. It's a good way to walk. How long did you walk? At the end of my sweat, I pass the toilet and face the 'whispering birch forest'.
   </p>
   <p>
    What should I say. Thousands of birch trees fill the white snow. It seems that if you enter the forest, the fairy will jump out here and there. Since it began to be boiled in the early 1990s, young birch trees that have just passed over are now known to the public in October 2012. When I entered the whispering birch forest, I understand why the birch is called the “queen of trees,” and the birch forest is called the “white rice of the forest.” It is a landscape without words.
   </p>
   <p>
    When you enter the forest, there are three walking courses: birch course (0.9km), healing course (1.5km), and exploration course (1.1km). Since they are connected to each other without any distinction, it is a good idea to walk through the birch forest regardless of the course. I feel like I'm facing the scenery I've only seen with movies or photos. Don't forget to touch the fine cuticle of the birch when you enter the forest. Don't miss looking up at the tall, high-nosed tip of the birch tree that filled the blue sky. The picture comes out no matter how you take it. If you still want to take great photos, take a wide-angle lens. Climb to the shelter's cabin, rest your neck and rest for a while.
   </p>
   <p>
    The birch forest in winter, which embraces a landscape that has never been experienced, provides rest and healing in itself. The troublesome thoughts that fill my head disappear by themselves. Is this something like “healing from nature” that I only heard in words? After a long time in the birch forest, I return to the road, and I keep looking back. 7km round-trip from forest post to birch forest. Trekking takes 2 hours, but depending on the length of time you stay in the birch forest, the total time required varies. Why don't you try harder this year and start looking for Wondae-ri birch forest around December when winter comes again? Recalling the birch flower saying, “I am waiting for you.”
