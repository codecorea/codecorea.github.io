    If you go to Daegu, there is Gwangsuk Kim. Singer Kim Gwang-seok, he was born and raised here in Daebong-dong. Imagine the 5-year-old Kim Gwang-seok playing around somewhere on this street. How was this space remembered for him?

   <p>
    It was in 2002 that I first met him. There was always a banquet on one side of the studio, but a song was playing by the side. Those songs were more likely to be drunk than alcohol. One day, as time passed and I understood the words of the weekly ‘When I get older, the day to find this song will come,’ I searched for his traces.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    It was an alley where he lived, which was sometimes a willingness to drink, and sometimes a willing comfort to a broken heart. I would definitely like to take a look at it once I have a chance.

    In 2009, 11 teams of artists joined together. The purpose was to create a Kim Gwang-seok road in honor of Kim Gwang-seok, who is better suited to the ‘Yuyu Poet’ than the singer. Kim Gwang-suk and his songs were recorded on the walls of the alley. The walls with lyrics of his song, which would not be lacking in poetry, provided an emotional journey to those who visited it. Did you add his song to it? When I am here, a cup is often eager.

   Bangcheon Market is a traditional market located next to Suseonggyo Bridge. The wall of Suseonggyo is the main of Kim Gwangseok-gil, so it can be said to be right next door. After liberation in 1945, people from Japan and Manchuria started their business. Like Pohang's Jukdo Market and Busan's Jagalchi Market, Bangcheon Market was created and cultivated around the liberation and around June 25th. At that time, Bangcheon Market sold grains from Namdojak. It can be seen that it was a very active market. It's a good time.

   In 2009, along with Kim Gwang-suk-gil, cultural artists flocked to the market. The art, which has flocked to the most intense daily market in everyday life, took off unnecessary clothing and brought to life. It's about bringing a new life to the market where art is falling. Every corner of the market began to be painted with pretty colored murals, and artists began to settle in the market one by one. The excitement they exuded was transmitted to the Bangcheon market, and this vitality is once again a driving force to attract people. In addition, the “Munjeonseong City” project was also added to promote the government's traditional market.

    Although barely alive, the market is still quiet. The galleries located all over the place attract attention. Anywhere is good, so you can go to your favorite place and watch it. Especially if you visit here on a date, don't forget to have a cool drink at a pretty cafe in the market place. If you're alone, it's also a good idea to taste the delicious red bean shaved ice at the price of 3,000 won at the bakery in the corner. The old walls and shop signs barely seem to hang at the end of time. It is dangerous, but it is still firmly in place.

    If you feel that Kim Gwangseok-gil and Bangcheon Market alone are not enough, you may want to continue walking through the alley tour including them.

   </p>
   <p>
    Alley tours are held twice every Saturday (10:00, 14:00). For groups of 15 or more, you can freely explore the course at any time if you make a reservation in advance. Alley tour application is Jung-gu Office of Daegu Metropolitan City (
