   Confess before starting the article. The reporter is an omnivorous man who is close to carnivorous, sharing a strong friendship with his flesh. Those who have been accustomed to the taste of chewing without caring about vegetarianism or sharing vegetarianism. This does not mean unusually looking for meat. Ordinarily, to put it plainly, I have eaten as soon as it is unbalanced. Paradoxically, this part is easier to understand by flipping the vegetarian tale of “There is no restaurant to eat.” That's because there aren't many restaurants in the land where vegetarians can eat comfortably.

    There are some vegetarian restaurants in Hongdae, the “diversity special zone” as “the liberation zone of youth.” The atmosphere is different from that of Jongno &amp; Insa-dong. Is it cafe which can serve meal? You can enjoy the brown rice health specialty restaurant Slobi, located near Exit 9 of Hongik Univ. I looked at &lt;Jack's Bean&gt;.

   There are a lot of specialty restaurants around Jongno &amp; Insa-dong, where Jogyesa Temple is located. Temple food, commonly referred to as “zebap,” is literally their food. According to the Buddhist doctrine that prohibits 'killing', it has a natural vegetarian diet and tastes without coming (green onions, garlic, soothe, leek, red cherries). The taste of modern man, who is domesticated by various seasonings and seasonings, is boring to the mouth, but after eating, many people find it comfortable and healthy.

   Finally, we introduce 'Klen's Juice', which excludes even the chewing taste. It is a popular detox diet that cleans the body with detox juice, which removes toxic substances from the body. The practice is to replace meals with juices squeezed with only vegetables and vegetables instead of rice. Juices made up of only vegetable and fruit juices taste better than you think. Depending on their physical condition, detox juices can be taken from 1 day to 2 weeks in length.
