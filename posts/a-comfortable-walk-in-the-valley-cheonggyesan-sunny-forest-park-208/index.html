    Headed to the mountain at the edge of winter. It is easy to think that the winter mountain is too cold, so it will be a burdensome or snowy road, making it a difficult journey. In a park located in the valley of Cheonggyesan Mountain, you can fold the idea for a while. The itinerary is okay for this trip, and it doesn't matter if you don't have climbing gear in winter. Introducing 'Cheonggyesan Sunny Forest Park'.

   'Cheonggye Mountain'
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Since ancient times, Gwanaksan and Cheonggyesan have been considered as' Mt. Cheonggyesan Mountain has a long, rising north-south direction, and there are many famous peaks along the ridge, including the main peak, Mangyeongdae, Oknyeobong, Mangyeongdae, Maebong, Isubong, and Guksabong. Mangyeongdae is said to have died in the midst of Goryeo saying that Cho Yun, a loyal and loyal figure, mourned for personality.
   </p>
   <p>
    Below the peaks, a magnificent veins stretch, and the valleys between them are deep valleys. Also, the characteristic of Cheonggyesan Mountain is a gneiss mountainous region, leading to a representative soil mountain in Korea. It is also famous for its good walking taste. Besides, there is always water flowing in the valley and the forest is full of freshness, so even in winter, on weekends, the mountain is crowded with many hikers.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Cheonggyesan is spreading in various places such as Seongnam-si, Gwacheon-si, Uiwang-si, and Seocho-gu in Seoul. Thanks to this, there are various ways to enter, but this time, you can use the road leading to Cheonggyesa Temple through Uiwang City. There are long cafes and restaurants along Cheonggye-ro.
   </p>
   <p>
    A parking lot comes out when you get closer to Cheonggyesan. The driveway between this parking lot and Cheonggyesa Temple is so narrow that the vehicles are snarling. Even people and vehicles walking along the side of the road are at stake, making them anxious. It would be nice to use public transportation, but if you have brought a vehicle, it would be nice to use this parking lot in many ways. Let's walk into the bosom while watching the mountains of Cheonggyesan that spread like a long body of blue dragon.

    When you enter about 400m from the stop with parking lot, you can see the information board of Cheonggyesan Sunny Forest Park and the walkway made up of decks starts. This park is a leisure space that utilizes state-owned land in the Uiwang City Development Restriction Zone, and is designed to allow all users to take a forest bath without discomfort. It is said to be a park to which the concept of 'barrier free' is applied.
   </p>
   <p>
    Barrier-free is said to have received good responses from developed countries in order to remove physical and institutional barriers to make the city more comfortable for the elderly and the disabled. In fact, the park's promenade is not all-round, but it is designed to make wheelchairs and strollers easy to move from early to mid.

    You can also meet Metasequoia Road, which was only felt in Damyang and Nami Island, in Sunny Forest Park. Metasequoia, which sits between the valley and the promenade running through the water, pokes the wide sky visible from the valley. As the ice of the valley melts little by little, the surface of the water is also beautiful. Dark brown leaves lay under transparent water. It is natural that the forest is lush and the water flowing in the valley is clean as it is called Mt. As the name of Cheonggyesan Mountain, it is full of landscapes with clear streams. It is good to be able to feel this coolness without leaving the metropolitan area.

    In the summer, white streams and foam flow coolly, and in winter, ice and snow are enough to give 'clear' to the forest that is full of winter mood. An empty space is created between the ice film and the water surface, and the sound of the water is ringing, but the sound of the clicking water is swaying.

    A small bridge comes out when you walk along a low slope. Crossing the bridge leads to a flat path along a deeper valley, and the road can also be comfortably walked, and it's quite long before you get on the slope, so it's good to spend plenty of time.

    If you climb up without crossing the bridge, you will reach Cheonggyesa Temple. Cheonggyesa Temple was designated as Cultural Property No. 6, and it is presumed to have been built at that time, as the unified Silla style was revealed at Seokdeungdo and Budo in the temple. At the time of the Three Kingdoms period, Uiwang-si was also the land of Baekje, and when the Goguryeo king Jangsu occupied it, Yulmok-gun was established.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is said that the Cheonggyesa Temple was built here in the battlefield as it moved to the Unified Silla Era, and the head nods. After that, it was reborn as a large-scale temple in the Goryeo Dynasty, and in the Joseon Dynasty, it was designated as the main temple of Zen by replacing Bongeunsa after the closure of the temple in Doseong in Yeonsan-gun.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was also famous for the 'Udambara Pin Cheonggyesa Temple', as a rare species that was thought to be a Udambara on the left eyebrow of the Guan Yin Bodhisattva of the Preservation of Heaven in 2000, became a hot topic.

    The Paradise Conservation is a pajak roof with 3 squares on the front and 2 squares on the side. In addition, there are 10 buildings including Jonggak, Samgakgak and Jijangjeon. Between Paradise Conservation and Wabul, you can see the same species designated as Treasure No. 11-7. It is one of eight species made by Sine Bugu, who has excellent skills in making traditional Silla-style species. At the top of the bell, two dragons seem to be carrying bells, and on the side of the bell, bodhisattva, lotus, and vines have delicate shapes.
