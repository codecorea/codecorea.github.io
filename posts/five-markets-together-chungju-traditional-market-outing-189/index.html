   Let's go to the free market first. The free market is a market formed on the streets of Bukmun where the North Gate was, when Chungju-eupseong existed. Existing on the 5th day As the city was formed, it established itself as the current free market.

   The free market tends to have more shops dealing with clothing, sandals, and fabrics than other places. In the past, there were many shops selling peppers, garlic, and rice, but it moved to the agricultural and fishery wholesale market in Chungju, opened in 1995, making it difficult to see the lively appearance as before.

   In the history of Mayor Chungju
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The history of Muhak Market, which is always visited by many people, such as Sundae Alley, has been around since 1978. When protests broke out in the process of cracking down on street vendors who had been in the position of the old gardening cooperative in Chung-in-dong, they settled in the current Muhak market by moving shopping malls in Munhwa-dong and Bongbang-dong. The Chungju Public Market leading to the Muhak Market was opened in 1964 in accordance with the government's market policy for small merchants.
