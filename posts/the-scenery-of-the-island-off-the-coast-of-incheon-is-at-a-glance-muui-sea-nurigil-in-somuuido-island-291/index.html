    In autumn, let's take a walk on a quiet island road. This is an island beach road that goes only by chubby boats and does not even drive. Muuido has long been known for its drama location, Hana Beach, and Horyonggoksan Mountain, but it is only recently that Somuuido, the younger brother of the island, has been word of mouth. As the bridge is laid from Samui Kumipo-gu, Muui-do to Somuui-do, and the path of Muui-San-Nuri is created, the path of those seeking it is increasing.

  <div class="txt_p">
   On weekends, the road to Muui-do became quite convenient. In the past, I changed buses two or three times, but these days, the Incheon Airport Railroad connects to Yongyu Temporary Station every weekend. When you get off at the train station, you can walk to the Jamjindo dock where the boat to Muuido departs and walk to the sea next to it. If you take a boat from Jamjindo Pier, it is only 5 minutes to Muuido Island. Ships run every 20 to 30 minutes, and buses come and go from time to time on the island, so there is no need to drive a car and enter the island.

   In fact, when I go to see the scenery of a secluded fishing village, there is nothing as frustrating as a passenger car overflowing. If you take a minibus from Muuido Pier, run across the island to Gwangmyeong Port on the other side. The tour of Somuido Island, walking on a quiet island, begins by sitting in the back of the bus and opening a car window and taking a deep breath. When the bus crossing the steep hills becomes as dark as it grows, other scenery of Muuido Island unfolds. The port is more familiar to the residents than the Gwangmyeong Port as Samkumi Village, and the small intention is curled across the port.

   In the past, the only way to connect Muuido with Soouido was by boat. Somuuido, the west and east villages were blocked by mountains, so you had to walk over mountain paths or go by boat. In Samkumi, the bridge started connecting the western village of Somuuido Island, and the island began to thrive as the Muui Sea Nuri Road was formed around the island.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Another name for Somuuido is 'Temuri'. The name of the west village dock that connects to the footbridge is also called the Temuri dock. The small island with a coastline length of 2.5 km has a history dating back more than 300 years. It is said that Mr. Park's family joined the three daughters and pioneered the island, and Yu Seongseong Village was formed by using Yu as a young man. A lot of shrimp were caught in the vicinity, and at one time, the island was rich enough to have about 40 fishing boats. Somuuido Island was also used as a military logistic base during the Incheon Landing Operation.
   <br/>
   On the island, there is a site where the festival was held, and there is also a beach where former President Park Jeong-hee stopped by his family for a recreational car. Around the island, the beach is exposed at low tide. The story of a remote island that even an angler could find would be like this.

   From beyond the 414m footbridge, the outline of the Muui sea nuri road made of wooden decks is revealed. The Muui Sea Nuri-gil is divided into eight sections. It takes only an hour to get around the island. If you bring a fishing rod, you can go fishing in the middle of the port in the middle, or sit on a cozy beach and taste lunch.

   Beyond the Buddha's Path, it leads to Mongyeo Beach. Unlike the bustling West Village, it is a way to enjoy the simple port and the beach atmosphere of Mongyeo Beach. You can fish here, but the area around Somuui-do is a hidden point for anglers who catch a lot of fish, sea bass, and surprises. The small size of 250m, Mongyeo Beach is a beach made of sand, white oyster shells, and mongdols.

   If you cross a hill on Mongyeo Beach, it leads to the beach of Myeongsa. This beach is a quiet place where former President Park Chung-hee enjoyed recreation with his family. Haenyeo Island-gil, south of Somuui-do Island, overlooks Haenyeo Island across the sea, and you can see the rock formations along the ridge. Under the beach path and Haenyeo Island Road of Myeongsa, if the water falls during low tide, you can enjoy a coastal trek to the general rock. The legend tells us that pirates saw the shape of a rock and mistook them as generals and soldiers.

   When you climb the highest mountain on the island (74m), sperm awaits. Here, the scenery around Somuuido Island can be seen at a glance. Yeongheung-do, Jawol-do, and Deokjeok-do were located in the southwest of Somuui-do. Ganghwa-do, Incheon International Airport in the north, Palmido, Incheon Bridge, and Songdo International City in the east lined up. It is time to enjoy the remote scenery of the island and the city at once on a secluded island.

   The short pine road in Ansan is the last course of the Muui Sea Nuri Road. If you descend the steep staircase, you will be taken back to the group. After completing a round of the Muui Sea Nuri-gil, the Gentiles enjoy the sea village, eat the conch, go around the alley, or lean the fishing rods at the group's marina, and enjoy the aftertaste of the island village. The relaxing autumn sun feels extraordinarily warm with the family.
