    Back to Samcheok's East Sea, I approached Dootasan, located in Baekdu-daegan. After passing several streams originating from the small and large valleys, as I entered more deeply, an order appeared and found a mountain temple. It is the 'Cheoneunsa Temple' that will be the center of this journey.

    In the vicinity of Haetalgyo Bridge, where the roof of Sansa can be seen at first glance, several protected trees over 200 years old create a strange atmosphere. When you raise your head along the stem, the branches of the old tree stretch and entangle as if the sky is cracked. This is a favorite scenery that can only be seen in winter. The valley below the bridge is wider than expected, and there are many relatively large rocks. Sansa by the valley is still quiet.

    Is it because it was built between the rough mountain slopes? The layout and composition of the building that stands out while entering the temple is unique. Beomjonggak and Bogwangru are at right angles, and when you climb down the stairs and climb the stairs, you fall in front of the stone pagoda and paradise.

    It was difficult to find the face of an old temple in a temple, stone pagoda, or stone temple, but to trace the history of this temple, it must be traced back to 758, the 17th year of King Gyeongdeok. Cheoneunsa Temple is the place where the legend that the three gods from Duta Samsun and India brought white lotus flowers was founded. It is said that after the establishment of the Paradise Conservation in the 4th year of King Heungdeok (829), it became a temple. In the Goryeo Dynasty, the relationship between Lee Seung-Hyu and the temple begins. Seung-Hyu Lee is a person who wrote the verse of King Chun-un and has a deep relationship with Cheon-eun-sa. Lee Seung-Hyu built a cottage under the Dootasan Mountain and borrowed a large blacksmith from the nearby Samhwasa Temple to study for over 10 years. Thus, the book he wrote is 'The King of Kings'.

    At the beginning of the Goryeo Dynasty and at the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty, the name of the temple, 'Cheoneunsa,' was built. In 1899, when making the wooden tomb of Lee Seong-Gye's four major ancestors, Cheoneun-sa was designated as the temple of Wondang.

    Like this, Cheoneunsa Temple, which has been under the Dootasan for over a thousand years, has a rare atmosphere, so it has a good atmosphere and a comfortable atmosphere. With the sound of the mountain breeze and the sound of a mountain bird taking off, I look around the baby's charming landscape and look at the objects with my heart in my mind. It feels as if we have finally found this place where Gangwon-do has overlooked the treasures of the rough mountains.

    Of course, trees are common in the mountains, but there are many trees that stand out among them. The appearance of the zelkova tree near the Liberation Bridge and the straight conifer tree behind the paradise is very impressive. Like a friend who has been around for a long time has been around. Seung-Hyu Lee, who built a villa in such a place and studied for over 10 years, what kind of record did he leave in the book The King of Kings?

    Designated as Treasure No. 418, 'The King of Kings' treats our nation as the main character of East Asia. In conveying the myth of Dangun, Silla, Goguryeo, Okje, Dongbu, and Yemac are all recorded as descendants of Dangun. Therefore, it was interpreted that our territory, beyond the Korean peninsula to Liaodong, was also our history. Also, he pointed out that the unification of Goryeo is a complete unification, unlike the unification of Silla. This can be said to be a valuable material to guess the perception of the time through Lee Seung-Hyu, a representative figure in the late Goryeo.

    Cheoneunsa Temple, which is used by the king of the nation, and Cheoneunsa Temple, built on the Baekdu-daegan, called the spine of the Korean Peninsula. I think I should listen to the mountain story behind. Doosan Mountain, which rises on the axis of Baekdu-daegan, descends to the East Sea, and appears to have the last strength. It is also the closest mountain to Cheoneunsa Temple.

    The word 'Shinum' of Mount Sinum means '50 um ', and is the name given because there are about 50 large and small um on the rock near the top of the mountain. Interestingly, the water in the water does not dry out ... Perhaps because of this phenomenon, traces of local faith such as rain gear and stone towers can be easily found on this mountain.

    There is a hiking trail leading to Sinumsan Mountain at 10 o'clock on the left from the front of Muyang Shrine. It is enough for 2 hours to slowly walk through the observation deck rocks overlooking the East Sea with a mountain of 683 m above sea level.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is also good to look around the mountain temple, but the cold wind over Baekdu-daegan in winter is a breeze. When the body begins to tremble, it enters the hiking trail. When I climb a little uphill, my breath stops and my body heats up. In this case, taking two hot packs can be a great help as you can melt your neck or hands when taking a picture in the middle or when you stop to rest for a while or enjoy the scenery.

    There are also some short courses that require you to climb up the ropes on the slopes of the valley that go into the mountains and climb from the valley to the ridge. But overall, it is not difficult to climb, and in winter, there is no need to prepare with one crampons.
   </p>
   <p>
    As the soil decreased and the rocky area increased, the tree climbed to the ridge that grew. Maybe it's not difficult. When I turned around, I was a little surprised by the East Sea. The pine tree, with its twigs pushed by the wind from the northwest, leaned toward the East Sea. Like pine trees, I enjoyed Samcheok City and the East Sea for a while and headed to the observation deck rocks.

    After climbing about 20 minutes from where the East Sea began to appear, you will arrive at the observation deck rock. The wind is bloody, as if it were not just beyond Baekdu-daegan. The surroundings are full of wind blowing. White snow accumulates and small snow like the sand of the desert rides the waves. Several stone towers are lined up with ice cream on the white snow.

    The scenery of the ridge of Mount Sinum 9 is in the middle of the mountain, but it has a pleasant taste. The panorama from the sky to the sea and Samcheok is a friendly feeling unlike the view from a very high mountain. It looks like it's called an observatory rock. While walking, it is full of charm that catches the eye, so I couldn't rest properly when I was resting, and I pressed the shutter of the camera. I took off my jacket, spread it out on my eyes, and laid my soft eyes with cushions. Is the sky blue anyway? As I got farther away from the dazzling sun, I was lying on the dark blue sky without knowing time was going.

    On the way back, there is a good place to solve one meal. There is a restaurant (Duta Sundubu House) next to the sign of Cheoneun Rest Area, about 400m from Cheoneunsa Temple Iljumun, is the history of Cheoneunsa Temple designated as Joposa Temple continued? It is famous for the good taste of tofu. If you add hot sauce and fresh tofu with a seasoning sauce and fresh kimchi with a spoon, you will eat cold but cold teeth. It's a special taste because it's made with a large amount of jjigaji on gong gippap. After eating all the tofu, bean curd, and rice, I feel happy that I have finished this trip deliciously.
