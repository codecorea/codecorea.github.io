   Pyeongchang-eup is located in Pyeongchang-gun, but it has a small feeling without being crowded. A rock park is located along the Pyeongchang River, which flows between Eupnae and Jangam Mountain. Boulders provided by nearby residents, such as seals, penguins, fresh rocks, Geumsugangsan, and turtle rocks, each boast a unique appearance.
