   As evidenced by its 100-year history, old blacksmiths, sundae gukbap, and uncle fry are still alive. There are some houses that have been handed down for generations, and some that have just entered the market, but the 100-year-old market is full of people buying and selling things every day. It is truly a scene of life.

   There is nothing in the market. It is not a chapter with or without something, but a chapter with or without something. Agri-food, livestock and processed foods abound, and old restaurants, mills, rice cakes, hardware stores, and daily necessities each occupy one place. In particular, alleys selling agricultural and marine products are hilarious with the high voices, laughter and anger of people who buy and sell.

    The appearance of a woman and a merchant who went out to the market to show off a bargaining spirit is an old sight of a traditional market. When you go to the market, you can feel the energy of people and the energy of life. Jang is also a place to buy or sell something, but it is also a place where people meet and people meet each other. It is a place where people who know or talk with people they do not know talk about living in disrespect and share affection. It is a place where you can hear new news from a distant world and unravel large and small stories one by one, one by one. It is a meeting place where people who know each other and know people who do not know and laugh and fight while facing each other. So even if there is not much to see, it is fun to visit the market.

   Beauty salon next to the mill

   <p>
    There are a few unusual scenery in the Sam Goul Market. One of them is the 'beauty salon next to the mill'. In the alley of the mill, 10 beauty salons were located one by one across the house. The rice cakes and peppers are left in the mill, and while they are crushed, her grandmothers and grandmothers are doing winding curls. While I'm out of the market, I see a market, do my hair, and wait for a long time, so I don't get bored. While the men are shouting at the soup restaurant and fluttering, the women fall into chattering at the beauty salon. After shaking for a long time, a long-lasting perm is completed, and the rice cake left in the mill waits with a warm face.

   There is another spectacle. It's been 100 years ago. In the blacksmith's office, quenching is in full swing. If you're lucky, you can meet the smith who makes the farming equipment by tapping and hitting it. The flipper's flipper machine is also quite antique. I'm worried that the old man's eardrum, which is being fried with corn, rice, and shouts for many years, “뻥 ~ yo”, is more worried about the surprise of the people standing around. Whether you buy it or not, if you eat a handful of deep-fried fried rice, you will feel the traditional taste of the traditional market, which cannot be found in the mart tasting corner.

   It is also worth boasting that the Sam Goul Market is a private market, not a public one. Traders develop their markets by discussing and planning head-to-head. Rather than moving according to someone's instructions or plans, merchants have united themselves to respond to change and adapt to it, and have continued a 100-year tradition. In the next year, which marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the market, the company plans to hold various cultural events with citizens through specialization projects for cultural tourism. It is a market with a history and tradition that can be found in textbooks.

   The Mayor of Sam Goul developed coupons to provide customers with fun and convenience. If you buy more than 5,000 won, you can give a coupon of 100 won and collect 30 coupons and use it like cash when you get 3,000 won. You can also give a prize by writing your name after the coupon. On the 2nd of every month, 20 people are drawn to give Onnuri gift certificates, and quarterly prizes such as electronic products are awarded. There is also a point card that earns 50 won once you stop by the market. Earn once a day, whether you buy or not. Even for those who don't spend 100 won, this is a joy.
