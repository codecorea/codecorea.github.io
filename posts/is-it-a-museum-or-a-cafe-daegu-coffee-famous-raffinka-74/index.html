   Happy Coffee Farm
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Daegu is at the center of the coffee shop nationwide. It is no exaggeration to say that the coffee loves of Daegu citizens began with “coffee masters”. The coffee shop opened in 1990, nine years ahead of the first Ewha Womans Starbucks store. The first shop, which opened at the north gate of Kyungpook National University, began roasting when it wasn't even enough to roast coffee itself. Those who spent their school days drinking Americano became high quality coffee lovers and made Daegu a city of coffee.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Daegu became a paradise for local coffee brands, with Da Vinci, Slipless in Seattle (SIS), hands coffee and Espresso. In the meantime, the number of coffee shops has grown to thirty-four places nationwide, and in December last year, the coffee shop Lapinka was opened in Manchon-dong, Suseong-gu.

From the name you can feel the truth of coffee.

   Ahn Myung-kyu, founder of the coffee master, calls himself a “coffee hunter”. Delicious coffee comes from fresh, good beans. Where there are good green beans, go to any rough road. They visit the farms of coffee-producing countries such as Guatemala, El Salvador, Kenya, Brazil, Colombia, and Ethiopia. In particular, it signed an exclusive contract with El Inherto Farm, which won the Guatemala Cup of Excellence for six consecutive years.

   Coffee shop Rafinka costs just 1,000 won for espresso and Americano every morning from 8 am to 30 minutes! This coffee is called 'happy coffee'. Happy coffee sales are all used as happy funds. The happy fund becomes a playground for coffee farmers who sell directly with coffee masters, a book, and even a teacher's salary. I want to keep the children there to keep good green beans. Perhaps the taste of coffee begins with the very heart.

   And a cup of communication with me

  <div class="txt_p">
   I asked Ahn Myung-kyu what is coffee in one word? “Coffee is communication.” In high school, when I went to the library as my home, he fell in love with coffee, saying that the conversation he had while drinking a cup of coffee offered by a teacher was warm and fragrant. In order to create a space to communicate with coffee, he opened a coffee house. The coffee master does not mean 'named house'. It uses the word ‘명 (明)’ to express the desire to create a bright space, that is, a space for communication. I just didn't want a coffee shop. I wanted to know the beginning of coffee, taste the coffee culture, and communicate through coffee.
