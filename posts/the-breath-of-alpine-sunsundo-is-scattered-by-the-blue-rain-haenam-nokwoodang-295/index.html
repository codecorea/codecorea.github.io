    Everyone experiences the end in life. There are various ends, such as a scheduled one and a sudden one, but it is difficult to get used to it. It would be a similar context if we wanted to go to the 'end of the earth' at least once. Because I have the expectation that I can start again after seeing the end of the earth and walking again.

   Namdo Exploration Station, Haenam, at the southern end of the Korean Peninsula
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    As the name suggests, the end of the Korean peninsula and the starting point of the land, as the name suggests, are located in the southernmost part of Haenam, the southernmost point of the peninsula. Thanks to this, people follow the symbolism of end and beginning to visit the end of Haenam. When departing from the metropolitan area, a full day is a distance you need to run. This is the reason why it is too much to look at the end of the earth after coming to Haenam. Let's take a look at every corner of Haenam. Haenam tour overflowing with highlights and food, starting from now on.
   </p>
   <p>
    When you open the map of Haenam, you can see the ruins of the high mountain Yunseon-do, Daeheungsa, Mihwangsa, and Gocheonam migratory birds that stretched out from side to side. A minimum of 2 nights and 3 days is required to properly explore all of this (based on self-driving from the metropolitan area). You can decide the route by adding or subtracting according to your preference and schedule. Remembering the end of the land where you can see both sunrises and sunsets, Mihwangsa, Gocheonam migratory birds, and flower gardens, which are considered as sunset points, can help you in choosing lodging and travel.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you enter Haenam Land after passing Haenam IC or Pyeongdong IC, there are nearby Gosan Yunseondo Historic Site and Daeheungsa Temple (Duryunsan Provincial Park). First, I visited the ruins of the Yunsan Island in Gosan and visited Daeheungsa Temple. After watching the sunset at Mihwangsa Temple, I decided to move to the end of the earth and stay for 1 night. The next day, it is a good time to see the sunrise of Memseom and look around the end of the earth. If the arrival time is in the afternoon, it is okay to first look at the end of the ground, watch the sunset and sunrise here, and then move in the opposite direction.

   Haenam Yoon, a prestigious family member of the Joseon Dynasty, is full of artifacts
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The journey of Haenam starts from the ruins of Yunseon-do, Gosan. Haenam is full of attractions, but it is regrettable except for the high mountains. Let's take a look at the relics exhibition at Yunseon Island in Gosan and head to the Nokwoodang area (History No. 1, historical site No. 167). Dongseon also continues naturally.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Opened in 2010, Gosan Yunseondo Relics Exhibition shows the situation of the times through the works of Gosan and Haenam Yoon's servants. You can also naturally learn about Haenam Yoon's family, which was a prestigious father-in-law. Heirlooms from Gosan, as well as his great-grandson Yun Doo-seo's tribute portraits (National Treasure No. 240), are handed down from generation to generation. It's amazing that there are so many treasures in a house. Each of the relics that filled the exhibition hall is conveyed by the descendants of the descendants who have kept nothing but light. It seems that he is facing a distant alpine entity that he met only in textbooks through &lt;The Fisherman History&gt; and &lt;Ouga&gt;.

   Let's take a look at Alpine. Gosan Yunseon (1587 ~ 1671). In 1628 (Injo 6), he started a manor at the beginning of the Byeolsimundae and became the master of Bongrimdaegun (Hyojong). Jung-soo, Noron's Yeong-su, Woo-am and Song Si-yeol. It would have been the best time of his political life filled with Guiyang and hermit. Nokwoodang is a house where the Bongrim Daegun descended to the throne and was given to the teacher, Gosan. The house in Suwon was moved to Gohaean as Hasan descended.

   Haenam Yoon's Jongtaek, which embraces Anchae, Sarangchae, Gosan shrine, Eochoeun shrine, and Chuwondang, is also referred to as Nokwoodang (Historical Site No. 167). Dang Ho, 'Nokwoo', was written by Ikdong Iseo (1662 ~ 1723), the first author of Donggukjin.

   Nokwoodang's plate is also his work. He was close with Yoon Doo-seo, a great-grandson of high mountains. It is a 'green rain' if you unravel the 'green'. Rain, which falls when the grass and trees are green, means fresh water of life. In addition, it is often interpreted as the sound of ginkgo leaves in front of Nokdangdang and the wind that sweeps through the forest behind Ndungdang.

    Is it because it is so famous as an alpine site? Eure Nokdang is regarded as the birthplace of an alpine mountain. In fact it is not. Looking at the relics' bilateral preliminary drafting document (Treasure No. 482-5), it can be seen that Alpine was adopted as a big house when he was 8 years old.

   When he first stepped on Haenam, he turned 25. Until then, he lived in Seoul. The longest stay in Seoul, except the 20 years spent in the exile in the life of Gosan in 1985, was Seoul. It is said that he stayed here in Haenam Nokwoodang for 6 years and Geumgye-dong for 9 years. I spent almost as much time in his hiding place in Bogildo, so if you want to feel more of the alpine trail, you should stop by Bogildo. At the end of the land, a passenger ship departs for Bogil Island (Ohwado Island).

   If you go to Nokdangdan, walk along the stone wall to the Visa Tree Forest. After passing the alpine shrine, Haenam's ancestral ancestral fishery, Echo Hyo-jeong (1476 ~ 1543), passes through the shrine, and the Visa Tree Forest Road is designated as a natural monument. Eochoeun, Hyojeong Yoon, took the ground at Nokwoodang and laid the foundation for Haenam Yoon to flourish. It was said that the descendants planted the Visa tree in response to his instruction, "If you see a rock on the back mountain, the village will be poor." This is also the reason why Haenam's delicacy was created. When they visited Mr. Haenam Yoon's Jongtaek, who said that farts would change, they were treated to Visa-made Korean tea and tea.
