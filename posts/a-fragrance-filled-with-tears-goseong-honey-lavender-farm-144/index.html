    Why did you sway 'You who came gently' to 'Purple'? When I was heading for Goseong Lavender Farm, I suddenly came across the lyrics of 'purple scent'. The thought that I've never had in my life has passed on this road, perhaps because my curiosity and anticipation about the purple world I'll meet soon dominated my mind.

   Shinni Lavender Farm, a new world met in Goseong
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The road to Goseong is long and rough. When you depart from Seoul, you must travel through Inje and Jinbu-ryeong for about 3 hours. Inje is the 38th border area that created "When and when you go to Inje," and Jinbu-ryeong is the stem of the Taebaek Mountains connecting Inje and Goseong. Novice drivers are even more reluctant because there are many winding roads. Nevertheless, there is a reason to head to Goseong. This is because it is now time for the lavenders of Hanni Lavender Farm to burst into purple flowers and create spectacular views. Lavender is a thankful thing to offer new sights in this poor season, where there is nothing but green to show until the foliage leaves. Knowing its uniqueness, people deliberately visit Goseong even on rainy days.

   If the main character is a lavender field that looks like a purple carpet, rye and poppy flowers in a colony are excellent supporting roles that shine lavender. Buildings with traces of the paintbrush left on the outer wall are also the best backgrounds for this flower garden. The mist that came down to the mountain is nicer today. It is like a stage device that maximizes the dreamy feeling of purple. Anyway, it all goes perfectly. I've never been there, but it's like any country in Europe I've always dreamed of. A smile never leaves the strange feeling.

   Let's go on a full-fledged lavender farm tour with an umbrella. Looking at the entrance, there is a lavender field on the front and right and a rye field on the left. The promenade is divided into two branches, left and right. The starting point on the milestone is the left side. Eventually, it is a course that returns to the origin and returns to the origin. However, there is a farmer's idea of drawing such a great picture on the canvas of the field, so I decided to follow it.

   The size of the rye field is not large. Even the expectation of rotten and tender rye can be a little disappointing. At this time, the rye has been overgrown, so it looks like a rice that is ripe in yellowness. Still, it has its own qualities, so it's good to walk along a path. After passing through the rye field, you will be greeted by a poppy colony located outside as if escorting lavender. Each one seems to show off its splendor with a bunch of water on it.

    On the other side of the entrance, Metasequoia stands like a folding screen. There are several tables and chairs between the trees, so it's good to take a break. Someone might think of words like 'unexpected' or 'accidental' while looking at metasequoia. However, it should be noted that this is also a landscape thoroughly calculated by the farmer. When the site was purchased, the landscaping farm, which was the owner of the original land, was given extra money to buy metasequoia. From the beginning, there was an idea to paint like this. Chestnut flowers are in full bloom outside Metasequoia Road. 'Isn't this too?' Think for a moment.

   Now it is time to observe lavender in earnest. Looking at the petals up close, the first impression is modest. Metasequoia and Poppy are very different from the ones that showed their greatness alone. It is much shorter than I thought. It's barely covering the knee.

   Until Hanni Lavender Farm became a wonderful farm as it is now, there was a bloody sweat of Ha Deok-ho. Lavender was the weapon of choice for selling different herbal teas online. I traveled abroad and looked for scenes that could be modeled. As a result, the honey lavender lavender farm was created by partially referring to the lavender fields in Hokkaido. In 2002, even the word landscape farming was unfamiliar.

   Goseong, Gangwon-do, which was warm in winter and cool in summer, was selected as the best place for lavender farm. There was no place like this to grow lavender, which had poor cold resistance. A variety of plants such as lavender, rye, poppy, and white pink celix were planted by purchasing suitable sites. At first it was difficult of course. Few customers visited the Goseong Valley, but the investment continued to be unknown. Eventually, some of the purchased land was sold to increase lavender. It's a small private farm, but it's a steady festival.

    The identity of 'You who approached lightly' appearing in 'Purple Scent' seems to be dim now. Perhaps he had a dreamy and subtle charm. It would have been better to shine than to shine yourself. If it met on a rainy day or at the dawn of the water mist, it would have shown a different face than usual. And at one time it was someone's tears. Like lavender.
