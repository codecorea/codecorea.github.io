    There is nothing to eat when you go out? The answer to your concern, long or short, is ramen. The national snack ramen, which can be boiled for 4 minutes in a pot, is surpassing the preconception of instant and passing through the prejudice of snacking and emerging as a meal.

    2013 marks the 50th anniversary of the launch of ramen in Korea. Ramen, which first came out in 1963, was a substitute for rice at the beginning of the market, but is now loved as a snack as much as stock. Our ramen love, which ranked No. 1 in the world with an average consumption of 72.4 people per person, is colorful and hot enough to be guessed by looking at more than 100 types of ramen. From ramen dishes filled with seafood and vegetables to hot pot ramen with memories, let's meet some of the best ramen restaurants in Seoul's hot places such as Samcheong-dong, Hongdae, Samseong-dong, and Myeong-dong.

    The ramen restaurant seems to be delicious if it is on a narrow alley. '55 Street Ramen 'is also on the back of Samcheong-dong, at the end of the Hanok alley. The address of 55-1, Hwa-dong, Jongno-gu was used as it is. When entering the main building across the small yard, Onggi people gather and eat ramen. At lunchtime, nine tables are around without a break.

    Underground passage 8-1 of Seolleung Station on Subway Line 2 is an alleyway that leads to a winding path called 'Hwangto Gunto Dam-myeon Odari'. Since it opened in 1998, it is not far behind the history of ramen shops. The owner, who was named as a soldier who cooks ramen deliciously during the military, received a patent by developing a vegetable water that brewed various vegetables for more than 6 hours, not just the idea of boiling ramen in the army dish.

   In addition to the vegetable water that produces a cool soup, Kimchi, which will go out as a side dish for one year, is soaked directly. Banhap Ramen, which contains the memories of the military, contains bean sprouts and sour-ripe kimchi. It is a popular side dish that is not to be missed. During lunchtime, from the 20s to the 60s, it is crowded with office workers looking for ramen with their own memories and nostalgia.
