    One of the best ceramics in the world is Goryeo celadon. Although celadon is from China, it has developed into an original Goryeo intestine that boasts a unique and beautiful color. Buan, Jeollabuk-do, along with Gangjin, Jeollanam-do, was the place where Goryeo celadon was in its heyday and was the best place to produce celadon. The Buan Celadon Museum, located in Yucheon-ri, where the garter remains, is a special space where you can meet Goryeo celadon more than 800 years ago.

From the handle of the door made of celadon, to the glassy surface of celadon (a residual glass phenomenon caused by air contraction when baking glaze on porcelain), from the yellowish initial color of Goryeo celadon to the wall that produced the color of various celadon If you look, you can experience the mysterious world of celadon.

On the 1st floor, there was a celadon production room, a celadon experience room, and a special video room where you can watch 4D images.

    In the Goryeo Dynasty, Buan was the place with the optimum requirements for producing the best quality celadon. Quality soil and trees were abundant, and maritime transportation was developed to carry celadon. Known as a tattoo and heraldryer in the Goryeo Dynasty, Lee Kyu-bo was appointed as Buan's woodworking house to manage the trees to be used as a royal palace. It was where high-quality wood was produced. Since Goryeo celadon was mainly used by royal and central nobles, it carried Hongseong, Taean, and Ganghwa through the sea to Kaesong, and the starting point was near Anheungchang. Anheungchang was the place where Chochang was in the Goryeo Dynasty, and it is currently around Gomso Port, and it is very close to Yucheonri, a celadon land.

    Cheongja Market in Buan remains in Yucheon-ri and Jinseo-ri, Jinseo-myeon. Over 70 kilns have been excavated so far. The first person to discover was a man named Nomori Ken, belonging to the Chosun Governor General in 1929. Since then, many Japanese people sneak Goryeo celadon and take it to their home countries, causing Goryeo celadon to suffer. The various celadon fragments and Koryo celadons that are now met at the museum are the ones purchased at Ewha Womans University after the liberation and the artifacts periodically purchased by the museum.

    The celadon history room was decorated with the history of ceramics. The history of pottery dates back to the Neolithic period. As the hunting mankind discovered the fire and settled in one place, the pottery's original 'bowl' was born. It is said that the birth of 'bowl', which is made using soil and fire, is an advanced technology to make a spacecraft. 'Bowl' continues to develop and shine as Goryeo celadon, the most beautiful in the world since the Goryeo Dynasty.

    The history of Goryeo celadon began when the mayor of China fell to North Song, and the porcelain craftsmen of the mayor came into Goryeo. As the Goryeo Dynasty entered, demand for celadon from the ruling class also contributed. Although the beginning was the ceramic culture of China, it was established as a representative crafts with decorativeness and practicality throughout the Goryeo Dynasty. Later, as time passed, it became a unique celadon of Goryeo. This is because the color of celadon called color and the original inlay technique was created.

    Goryeo celadon has a unique color, not that of China. 'Rain' is a Chinese character using the kingfisher rain (翡), which is the color of the kingfisher's feathers. Looking at the photos of the kingfisher, there is a bluish energy, but it is difficult to define any color, but you can quickly see that it is a mysterious and subdued color. The head nods to the words "color is the color in a person's mind." During the Song Dynasty in China, Seogye praised the beauty of Goryeo celadon's sophistication and color in the book 《Sunhwa Volunteer Goryeo Dynasty》 written after coming to Korea as an envoy. The white porcelain is the best in Zhengzhou, but the celadon praised the color, saying, "The color of Goryeo is the best in the world."
    <br/>
    In the celadon history room, you can look at the history of celadon at a glance. You can meet everything from practical works, such as the early Hamu-ri-gu cups, dishes, and kettles, to beautiful inlays with unique color and inlay techniques. The unfinished celadon and debris excavated from Yucheon-ri, the representative land of Buan, also remain intact as they continue to pass through the years.

    The inlay technique was first invented by Goryeo potters. It refers to engraving the surface of the molded porcelain and scraping it with white clay and clay (red soil), and then baking it with glaze. In simple terms, it is a technique that digs out part of the raw material and fills in other materials on the spot to preserve the pattern. The Goryeo celadon is divided into the period of pure listeners and inlaid listeners based on the 12th century. If the 12th century was the age of pure listeners without any patterns or patterns, after the 12th century, it was the heyday of inclined listeners and inlaid listeners.

    In the celadon luxury room, you can see about 30 authentic inlays of various inlaid celadon during the period when celadon was in its heyday. The more you look at the lotus stem pattern hawk bottle, chrysanthemum pattern gourd-shaped kettle, peony and chrysanthemum pattern melon-shaped bottle, the more you fall in love with it. This is because there are other works of art hidden in the inlaid audience, such as beautiful flower patterns such as chrysanthemums and peonies, cranes flying in the clouds, and waterside scenery with water birds and trees.

    Visiting the Cheongja Production Room on the 1st floor starts with seeing the deep waters of the Biando Sea. In 2002, more than 3,000 celadon crusts were discovered in the waters of Biando off the coast of Buan. At the entrance to the celadon production room, the appearance at the time of excavation is reproduced, and this is a space to infer the process from celadon production to transportation through the celadon transport ship that met and sank. Starting with the soil, defence, and soil, the entire process was reproduced, from molding to shape using a spinning wheel, glazing through intaglio and inlay, baking from the kiln, and inspection of finished products and packaging for shipping.
