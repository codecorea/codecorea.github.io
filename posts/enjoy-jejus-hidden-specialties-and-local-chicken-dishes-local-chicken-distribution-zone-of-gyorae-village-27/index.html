   Chicken is a common food that can be found anywhere in the country, but in Jeju, the chicken is a delicious delicacy. This is a place where you can taste various pure chickens, which are grown with fresh air from Hallasan, with shabu shabu, white soy sauce, and kalguksu.

   Do you know the local chicken village of Gyoraeri?
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Gyoraeri, located in the middle of the eastern part of Jeju, is famous for its local chicken village. Bijarim is located across the village, lined with local chicken restaurants. From chicken stir-fried chicken to white dishes and chicken kalguksu, as well as special menus such as chicken shabu-shabu, chicken enthusiasts can't overlook them.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Gyorae-ri became known as the Indigenous Chicken Village since the late 1970s. Located in the highlands of 400m above sea level, Gyoraeri is a rocky Gotjawal terrain and cold and snowy. Hunting and breeding have been developed instead of farming since ancient times. Although the village was ruined by 4.3 incidents around 1950, it gradually recovered and began to be called the local chicken village as the number of domestic chicken breeding farms increased in the late 1970s.
   <br/>
   Since then, roads have been expanded through the villages, and tourist facilities have been built nearby, creating a specialty restaurant using local chicken, a local specialty. It's a local chicken restaurant street. In 2009, it was designated as a local chicken distribution zone in Jeju Island and continues the reputation of Korean chicken villages.

   The secret of the local chicken dish is fresh ingredients
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Drinking fresh air from Hallasan and playing in green grassland, Gyoraeri chicken is definitely different in size and chewy compared to other chickens. Your muscles develop, so you don't need extra fat and you're full. Above all, native chicken is freshness. The reason why the local chicken dishes are delicious is because they eat the live chicken instead of frozen chicken.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   There are also homes where local chickens are raised, but most have small farms on one side of the restaurant and sometimes take chickens from poultry farms. Some restaurants prepare daily meals in the morning and cook them immediately after ordering. It's all about getting fresh ingredients. Even if the recipes or seasonings are slightly different from house to house, the fresh ingredients are used first of all, so the basics are wherever you go.

   Chicken breasts are usually unpopular because of their rich texture. Vegetables such as cabbage, green onions, and mushrooms are mixed and soaked in sour sauce. The light taste of chicken breast is the same, but you can feel it with a thin texture. The chicken dung house and the skin that comes with it go without any refusal. The hot broth from the oil is easy to eat with a simple taste.
