   Garorim Bay, surrounded by Seosan-si and Taean-gun, Chungnam, is one of the five largest tidal flats in the world. It is so clean that the sea is added to the forest with dew. Fresh seafood springs up like pollination in all seasons. Jungali Village Experience Village in Jigok-myeon, Seosan-si is famous for the Oeok-nakji Festival in Gaet Village in autumn. In March-May, the clam that has been plump for the season waits for Gilson. Thanks to the abundance of fishery resources, experiences, and unspoiled natural environment, we won the Grand Prize at the 2014 Fishing Village Advancement Competition.

   At the Jungali Village Experience Village ticket office, which arrived on time, the booths were crowded with experienced visitors who changed their boots from early morning. As soon as the kids with the net and hoe got on the electric cart, they were excited. Jungripo-gu is an endless stretch of tidal flats. The children, who traveled around the tidal-flat of their feet, fall into a clam samgye with a hoe in their fern hands.

   The small shellfish is saved and the thick one is picked up in the net. However, the shellfish at this time is full of flavor even though it looks small. The clam filled with one net is about 2-3 kg. The time required for the experience is not set separately, but after a couple of hours, the tidal flats are filled with water. The experience fee is 10,000 won per person, including tools.

   If you look for the time when the water comes in, you can try fishing on board. They are mainly caught, songme and flatfish. It is possible to get into the shallow water, catching ponies, mullets, crabs, shrimps, and other side nets in June when the water temperature starts to rise. After mid-May, octopus catching experiences await families. The bamboo primrose, a traditional primitive fishing method, is installed 20m long so that you can catch octopus by tumbling across the tidal flats.

   Fishermen's Happiness Center also runs an experience program such as making taetae chocolate. Ecklonia is a rare seaweed that blooms only from December to April in a limited area of Seosan Garorim Bay. Picking is difficult, and the process of washing and drying by hand is also very expensive. It looks similar to Mae-sae-gi, but it is called 'sea vegetables of the sea' because of its stronger fragrance and excellent efficacy.

Wall paintings and installations follow the concept of 'Walking through the Shinmong Judo Garden'. Seosan Jigok-myeon, where Jungwang-ri is located, is known as the hometown of the Korean electric painter, who drew the Mont Yudo Island. If &lt;Mondedo Island&gt; was the dream of Anpyeongdae, the landscapes of Jigok-myeon with only the landscape would not affect the style of the dog.
