   Walk the 10.2km 'Haneulgil' formed on Baekwoon Mountain, the back mountain of Jeongseon High1 Resort. It was called “Untan Road,” which was carrying coal during the booming period of coal, and it was also called “flower arthropod” because it hungered wild flowers such as rhododendrons when they were hungry and soothed their hunger. Another name, 'Hwajeolryeong', is a Chinese character name for 'flower fold'. The flowers bloom beautifully in Hwajeolryeong 'flower arrangement' today.

   Baekwoon Mountain (1,426m) on the border between Sangdong-eup, Yeongwol-gun, Gangwon-do, and Sabuk, Jeongseon-gun, and Gohan. There is a famous head on Mt. Baewoon, which means 'a mountain with white clouds.' In the days when the whole country was hungry, people had to pick up the flowers that bloomed in the mountains in order to cross the so-called barley head, which was higher than Baekwoon Mountain, where the clouds couldn't be caught. That's why the name 'Flower Arrangement' was attached to the pass. Nowadays, people who are full of food don't pick flowers anymore, but today, they enjoy a prosperous walk with their hearts on the wild flowers blooming on the hills.

    The flower arthropod was the way to transport coal during the coal boom. That's why it is also called “Untan Road”. From 1948 to 2004, you need to stop by the “root tube” in order to feel the depth of the sweat and tears of those who risked their lives in 88 coal mines and underground yards in Jeongseon.

  <div class="txt_p">
   You can take a look at the history of Jeongseon's coal mine in the Root Pavilion and various stories of people who worked in the coal mine through data and restoration models. According to the data, more than 25,500 people lived in coal mines only in the North Korean region. It is said that 40,000 people surpassed the number of coal mining workers in various areas of Jeongseon-gun in addition to North Korea. The people who could form one municipality worked in the mine. However, in Jeongseon Valley, there was no place for many people to live. Although there was a house, two rooms, one kitchen, and a toilet were used in a common area of 5 to 6 pyeong. However, there were less than half of the workers who could move into the house. The rest of the workers had to live in three rooms, where one could lie down, or by living on a mountain.
