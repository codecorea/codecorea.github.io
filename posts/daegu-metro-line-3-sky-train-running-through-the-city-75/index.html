   "Aze ~ This station is a achievement park." “Yeah, this station is Aigar Park Station where Saturn is located. If you are going to Dalseong Park or Daegu Native History Museum, you can get off at the right door. ”The Daegu Urban Railway Line 3, where the dialect announcement is heard, is catching the air. The first urban railway was opened in Daegu in 1997. Line 2 was completed in 2005, and line 3 began service on April 23, 10 years later. By May 31, there are 3 million visitors. An average of 76,500 people a day ride the train, which makes it more popular.

In Nam-gu, the mountains in front of the dense dwelling roofs face each other, and the Suseong Pond appears to the right as the Suseong Pond Station approaches. Behind the scenes, the sun breaks along the white waves and the train slides through the buildings. It is unexplored in Daegu.

Car lights passing under the trains flow like rivers, and the buildings standing on both sides along the Beomcheon stream catch the eye. It's also special to see the sun shining and reddening the building forest on the train.

   The sky train that runs from Daegu to north and south passes through 30 stations, ranging from Dongho-dong Chilgok Gyeongdae Hospital Station in Buk-gu to Beommul-dong Site in Suseong-gu. It takes 48 minutes to pass through the entire 24km section. It runs cool without waiting for a signal or being stuffy. It took 20 minutes or more to take more than 70 minutes when using a car. It runs from 5:30 am to 12:00 pm, every five minutes during morning and evening rush hours, and every other seven minutes. The rubber wheel of the vehicle is wrapped around the track beam to drive, so there is little noise and vibration, and the ride is comfortable, so you can feel comfortable in the scenery.

   Daegu Sky Train is Korea's first public transport monorail. In the world, there are not many examples of monorail in public transportation. It operates in 14 countries around the world, including Tokyo, Japan, Osaka, Chongqing, China and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Among them, the Daegu sky train is the longest. We are proud of the best in technical part. As you pass through apartments and dense residential areas, a window-blocking device will protect your privacy. In the event of an emergency, Spiral Chute and a water spray-type automatic fire extinguishing system were installed to escape safely to the ground. It's an unattended operation, but worry can be put aside. One safety officer rides on each vehicle and monitors Chilgok vehicle base control system in real time through CCTV.

   The station that people ride most is Seomun Market Station. The opening of Line 3 increased the number of visitors to the market by 40% on weekends. Exit the escalator at Exit 3 and you're at the market entrance. Previously, you had to walk 10 minutes from Sinnam Station on Line 2. Seomun Market, which was selected as the three largest market place in the Joseon Dynasty with Pyongyang and Ganggyeongjang, is the largest traditional market in Daegu. There are 4,700 stores in eight districts, including Dongsan Shopping Mall, except street vendors. There are so many things to see and do that you can't go around with half a day.

   If people are crowded at Seomun Market Station during the day, it is Suseongmot Station at night. Beomeocheon, which stretches straight up and down the Suseongmot Station, is a newly emerging photo zone. The dimly lit buildings and colorful buildings blend together to create a new look of Daegu night view. After watching the night view of Beomeocheon, you can walk about 5 minutes to Suseong Pond. Unlike the daytime scenery where you can enjoy the cool breeze of the lake and take a duck boat, the night view of Suseong Pond is gorgeous. A cool fountain show takes place to match the lighting and music. A variety of street performances take you around the promenade around the lake.
