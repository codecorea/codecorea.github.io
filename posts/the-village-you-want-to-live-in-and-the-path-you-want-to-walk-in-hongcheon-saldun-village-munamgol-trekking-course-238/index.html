    When I go on a trip, there is a place where I feel like 'Oh ~ I want to live in a place like this'. If you are in Hongcheon-gun, Saldun Village is such a place. I wonder if the name of the village is 'Dudeok worth living'. If you want to soothe your desire to live in Saldun, you can stay at a campsite or pension run by Saldun Village, and spending a night in a private home is a pretty good way. Even if you don't reap the life you've already had in the city in a day, why don't you forget about all the tiredness of your life for a day, sometimes with a gentle killing?

   The way to get out of the highway to Saldun village is 'the way the grandmother and the grandmother cross the road and the road.' There is no such thing as a straight road. A car that spins back and forth as if it has motion sickness makes the body sway. You can't pay, you can't pay. It reduces the speed of life paths that cannot be reduced by itself, instead of meandering.

   There are ashes on the way. The scenery of Jeollado over a car is amazing. The scenery of the villagers leaning on the hills and the scenery of the passing rural village give a rest to the heart. In order to get into Saldun village from within Hongcheon-eup, you have to go as far as the distance from Seoul. After coming into Hongcheon, it is the way to live. This road was also drilled in the early 90s, so it was a remote area before. Surrounded by mountains over 1,500 meters above sea level, Saldun is located in a remote area deep enough to have been named as a “good place to live” in “Junggamrok”.

   When you run for about an hour like that, you will reach Saldun village, which is surrounded by mountains. About 40 households live in Saldun Village. Sewol turned all the old mountain villages into modern houses, but the nature surrounding the village remains the same. The Naerin Stream flowing out of the mountain stem, the Sardun Valley that winds through Saldun, the stems of Bangtaesan surrounding the village, the clear wind and sunlight, and the cold air that clears deep into the lungs remain the same.

    Hongcheon is colored with autumn leaves before Seoul. Moreover, the altitude of high altitude is high, so Saldun grows vegetables more quickly. The Moonamgol trekking course in the third week of October is also in full bloom with reddish-yellow leaves. Munsan Island has a bright light. The life of a person walking while looking at the red and yellow leaves is also a way to mature.
    <br/>
    It is the Munamgol Trekking Course when you cross one from Saldun Village. However, there is no bridge, so you have to go 3 to 4 km by car. From the main road, follow the signpost of the hollyhock and the road begins.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    This course is called 'the way you want to walk' for those who like to walk. Walk 4 to 5 km one way, 8 to 10 km round trip, and walk back to the three-way intersection where Yuljeon 2-ri ends. If you keep walking, you will see Yuljeon 3-ri, and the road continues up the road. There is no reason to wander because it is an external road to Samgeori. If you go up to the three-way intersection with a small bridge and then come back, it is enough to walk for 2-3 hours.

    This path is not a lush path like any other forest path, but rather a forest path along the valley, so it is not a good way to walk in the summer. This is because it does not create a shade to avoid sunlight. So it is good to walk in spring and autumn. In deep villages and deep roads, it's good to think through the sound of footsteps and streams of valley water. There is no up and down. Even if it is not hiking, it is not difficult to walk even if you wear only shoes. The color-decorated autumn welcomes you, so your steps are light.

   Weekend in the dark

  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    There are many ways to enjoy Saldun, but how about spending a day at the Sangdun Campus Camping Site, which is made using the closed school? It's also a good idea to give yourself a weekend filled with nature. The Saldun Valley flows beside the camping ground. There is no place like this as a place for playing in the summer. It is safe to wear a life jacket because the water is deep, but it is free to rent to campers at the campsite. Bicycles can be rented for free, and movies are shown outdoors on the weekends.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Compared to other campsites with clear site divisions, the attractiveness of Sangdun Branch Camping Camp using a closed school and a valley is natural. You can set up tents where you want around the playground and valley and enjoy the day buried in nature. The daily fee for a camping site is 25,000 won per weekday per tent, and 30,000 won per weekend and peak season.

   Saengdun Branch Camping Camp, which can hold 30 tents, is jointly operated by Saldun Village. You can also stay in the pension if you are troubled with camping by operating 5 pensions right next door. Rental camping sites are available free of charge for travelers staying in pensions. The campground is only open until the third weekend in November and is closed in winter.

    Instead, in winter, you can enjoy camping at Saldun Cottage. The hut is a mixture of Japanese-style houses and temples. There are 3 rooms on the 1st floor, and there is a living room on the 2nd floor where you can drink tea and view the scenery. Camping is also available in the yard. Camping is open all year round and costs 30,000 won on weekdays and 40,000 won on weekends per site.

    A place where I want to live by pressing, but being comforted by being able to stay for a while. People who came to Saldun say that transportation is inconvenient, and it is better to come back. You can avoid the hassle of finding only those who really want to come. So those who love Saldun want this place to no longer be famous. In winter, I need to quietly come back to this village where Sobok has snowed.
