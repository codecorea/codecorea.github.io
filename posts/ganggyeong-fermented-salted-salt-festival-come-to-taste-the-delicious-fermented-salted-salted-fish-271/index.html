    Kang Kyung, who once occupied the “three major markets of Joseon” with Pyongyang and Daegu, still remembers the revival of the time with the “Fermented Salted Salt Festival” every fall. The presence of a large market meant that there were a lot of goods and people coming and going. Thanks to him, Kang Kyung is also a living 'History Museum'. At the “Ganggyeong Fermented Jeotgal Festival”, the 17th anniversary of this year in 2013, we toured the history of Ganggyeong as well as various salted fish. Indifferent silver grass on the banks of the Geumgang River floating on the Hwangpo Sail Boat greets people.

    Until October 20th, the 'Ganggyeong Fermented Jeotgal Festival' will be held at Ganggyeong Pogu, nearby Jeotgal Market, and the village of Oknyeobong. What is the taste of chopped salt that has been matured and fermented by traditional methods that have been practiced for centuries? There are not many people who gathered with curiosity from the first day of the festival. As I am looking at the festival hall, it seems like I came back to the peak of Ganggyeongpo-gu about 100 years ago. The history of Ganggyeong, where more than a hundred boats went in and out during the season, is depicted as a temple.

   In order to know Ganggyeong Pogu, he must first look at the stem of the Geumgang he held. The Geumgang, which reaches the Cheonri, originates from Sinmu Mountain in Jangsu, Jeollabuk-do, and passes through the princess and Buyeo to dig into the river. The Geumgang stem splits between Chungnam and Jeonbuk until it reaches Ganggyeong and mixes with the West Sea. Located on the lower reaches of the Geumgang River, Kanggyeong is the deepest inland in the West Sea.

   'Ganggyeong Pogu' plays an important role in the position of Ganggyeong where fresh and salt water flows. It was the largest fishing port on the west coast and the main point of transportation between Chungcheongdo and Jeolla-do. People flocked by waterways and by land, followed by supplies. It was also a passageway for seawater to enter the inland, making it a perfect destination for marine products.

   The development of civilization was also rapid. It was said that it was equipped with electric water supply facilities in the 1920s, so it was once a place that achieved a really fast “modernization” on the Korean Peninsula. So far, the old buildings that remained all over town in Ganggyeong weren't the latest buildings at the time.

However, it is also true that it is not easy to remember the old movies of Kang Kyung after seeing them so lonely.

    The shining days of Ganggyeong end in 1914 when the Janghang Line railroad was laid down and the Korean War was fought. As it was a big city, the damage of the war was great, and the development of overland transportation weakened the position of Ganggyeong Pogu. So a long time passed. Ganggyeong has become a quiet and small town, regardless of its prestige. The 'Ganggyeong Fermented Salted Salt Festival', which can remember the 'Ganggyeong' in its heyday, is only a relief. It is thanks to those who remember the film at the time, and the natives who took hold of the river after generations.

   Now that we have reviewed the history of Ganggyeong, let's go on a full-scale festival tour. Among the strongest salted salted fish, shrimp is the first choice. From 'yukjeot' in June, 'oot' in May, and 'chuot' in autumn. There are three types of shrimp sauce.
