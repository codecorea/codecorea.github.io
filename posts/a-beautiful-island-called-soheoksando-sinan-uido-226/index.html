    Uido, named after the ears of a cow, is an island about three and a half hours away from Mokpo by boat and is well known for its sand dunes. It is a beautiful island not only with clear and clean beaches such as Donmok, Seongchon, and the beach beyond the band, but also the scenery of the tea ceremony on the top of Sangsanbong. It is also the exile site of the Sonam Jeongyakjeon and remains a dock in the Joseon Dynasty that retains the old image. Let's take a look at the history of Uido along with the unexplored Uido.

   Fragrance of Jeongyakjeon in Truth Village, 《Pyohae Shimsal》 and Uido Dock

  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    A ferry to Uido departing from Mokpo Coastal Passenger Terminal arrives in Uido in three and a half hours via Tochodo. Kaido, which serves as the gate of Uido, greets the passenger ship first, and the ship arrives at Uido Port, where the truth village (Ui 1 District) is located. On the other side of Uido Port, where the truth village is located, you can see East and West Souido and Songdo. Uido is the name given to Dori and Mokseom, which protrude to the west of the island, resembling the shape of a cow's ears. Other names are called Sogu Island and Ugaedo Island. Uido is mostly dependent on fishing because it has very few farmland due to the development of mountainous areas around Sangsanbong, the highest elevation on the island, 359m above sea level.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   In Uido, there are quite a few historical and cultural heritages. In 1801, the brothers Son Jeong-jak and Dasan Jeong Yak-yong went on their way to Guiyang after spending the last night at Yuljeongjeom intersection at Geumseongsan Mountain in Naju. The exile site of Jeongyakjeon was Uido, which was called Soheksando Island. Heuksando is well-known as the place of exile in Jeongyakjeon, but Jeongyakjeon seems to have loved Uido more. He first settled in Uido, and only in 1807 went into Heuksan-do, 40 km from Uido. There is also a record that the Jeong Yak-jeon was caught secretly at night to go to Ui-do near the land.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   During the exile in Daeheksan-do, Jeong Yak-jeon, who left behind 《Assassin ’, left a book titled‘ Pyohae-shim ’during his exile in Soeuksan-do. The story of Pyohae Shim-moon tells the story of Moon Soon-deuk, who lived as a spearfisher on Soheksan Island. Moon Soon-deuk, who learned of Jeong Yak-jeon during his exile, went to buy a redfish on a nearby Taesado Island and drifted to meet Pung Rang. He survived fortunately, and returned to his hometown in three years and two months through Okinawa, the Philippines, Macau, Nanjing and Beijing. In the 9th year article of the Joseon Dynasty, there was a record in the article of the 9th year of King Sunjo, saying, "I order you to repatriate the drifter of the country of transit." He unveiled the full story that he experienced while traveling around the world different from that of Joseon to Jeong Yak-jeon, and the book he wrote based on his dictation is the poetry. In Uido, there remains the birthplace of Hong Soo Jangsu, Sun Soon-deuk, along with the exile of Son Am Jeong-jeon.

    At the entrance to the Truth Village, there are traces of Uido's strategic importance in the Joseon Dynasty. This is the Uido dock. Uido was also used as a naval base during the Joseon Dynasty, and it is said that there was a gwan-a and a hill at the foot of the truth village. The Uido Dock was created in 1745 during the Joseon Dynasty. He was responsible for the function of the muzzle to anchor the ship, the breakwater to prevent waves, and the shipyard to build and repair the ship. In fact, it is said that the boat was cut from a nearby mountain in the mountains. The Uido dock is made by stacking stones at a height of 3m. In the center of the dock, there is also a relay line that binds the boat. The Uido Dock is the oldest and most intact dock in Korea, and was designated as Monument No. 243 in Jeollanam-do.

   Where to stay in Uido is Truth Village in the east of Uido, Donmok in the west, and Seongchon Village. If you want to look around Uido, you have to bear the inconvenience of moving on foot. The mountain and sea can be enjoyed at the same time, making it a very attractive place for travelers who have plenty of time or want to enjoy nature.

  <div class="txt_p">
   The beach beyond the band, located about 1 km away from the truth village, is not well known due to the popularity of Donmok and Seongchon Beach, but it is the most beautiful beach in Uido. Beyond the band, the beach is a place that has many belts used instead of rice straw when connecting thatch roofs. The belt reaches the beach only when it crosses a hill that forms a colony like a field.

    If you climb the uphill road about 500m from the crossroads over the band, the beach spreads out over the band down the hill. On the hills, there are piles of rainrooms (stone walls) built to prevent wind. When you descend the hill, the beach beyond the band, about 1km long, reveals itself. The foot of the mountain, which descended from Sangsanbong, fell to the beach, separating the beach beyond the band and the Seongchon beach beyond. It is a fault that the waves are strong, but it is perfect for swimming in the sea because it has a fine and hard white sand.

    When you come out of the crossroads over the beach and go up the road to Donmok and Seongchon villages, you reach the truth hill near the water supply source of Uido people. The truth hill is a way to climb to the highest peak in Uido, Sangsan Peak. The road is not rough, so you can climb without hesitation. After about 10 minutes, the mountain peaks around Sangsan Peak slowly appear. Uido's appearance is clear along the border between the island and the sea. As you climb the Sangsan Peak, the breathtaking view of the tea ceremony unfolds so that your heart can pierce. To the east, the truth village is not visible due to the peak in front of Sangsan Peak, but there are more and more islands off the coast of Sinan, including Uido Port and Gado, Songdo, East and West Souido, as well as Bigeumdo, Tochodo, Hauido, and Sangha and Hataedo. . To the west, it overlooks Donmok Village, Seongchon Village, and the Donmok Beach filling the gap. In the mountains, traces of villages are also found. It is the first town in Uido, but it is now the ruins of Daechori Village.

   After passing Daechori Village, you will reach Donmok Beach. The left side of Donmok Beach is Donmok Village and the right side is Seongchon Village. The sand dunes on Donmok Beach are Uido's representative spots. It is also the place where the protagonist, Democrat Kim Ji-soo, was found in the film &lt;Autumn&gt; for a documentary filming. The sand dunes are 100m above sea level and 20m wide, and are known as the largest Pungseong sand dunes in the East. Between Seongchon Beach and Donmok Beach, the beach and sand dunes go well together. Right now, it is forbidden to enter the park to protect the sand dunes, but it's a painful effort to get back to the old look. At the moment, you can't go in and out to protect the sand dunes, but the scenery of the sand dunes looking over the Donmok Beach changes from time to time.

   Located between Donmok Village and Seongchon Village, Donmok Beach has a long beach about 1.5km long. This sandy and hard beach is the most popular beach in Uido. In particular, this year, it was selected as one of the cleanest beaches in the water quality test of 187 beaches. Dalmulge is full of people's feet on the beach of Donmok. It is said to be the largest dwelling colony in Korea. When it feels popular, the crab quickly runs away with cute side steps.

    The ferry to Uido departs once a day from Mokpo. The trip is a bit unique, so if you take advantage of it, your trip to Uido will be easier. When you depart from Mokpo at 11:40 am, you will first arrive at the truth village of Ui 1-gu via Tochodo, and then arrive clockwise through East and West Soido, Yeri, Donmok, and Seongchon. The ship departs at Tocho-do for one day and departs at 6 am. After passing through the opposite directions of Seongchon, Donmok, Yeri, Dong-seoso-ido, and Truth, we go to Mokpo through Tocho-do.
