    The Sabuk and Gohan regions of Jeongseon, Gangwon-do, were Korea's representative coal mining sites. When the coal industry boomed in the 1970's and 1980's, money was overflowing enough to say that dogs carry ten thousand won. However, in 1989, the coal industry walked down due to the rationalization policy of the abandoned mine and production cuts. As the coal mine disappeared, the mining villages of Sabuk and Gohan were devastated. Like the words `` Sae-ji-ma '', they rose to coal and stagnated to coal. Now, Sabuk and Gohan are rising again with tourism based on coal. Along the fascinating coal mine attractions, we look forward to the past, present and future of Jeongseon.

   The center of Jeongseon Coal Mine Trip is Untan Altitude. Reminiscent of China's Chama Island, this road used to carry coal from Manhangjae to Hambaek Station. Trekking on the Untan Altitude requires time and stamina as it is the only mountain trail in Korea to be built at high altitudes of more than 1,100 meters. But don't be scared before you start. Because there is an easy way to climb. The mountain gondola (2832m) of High1 Ski Resort is used.

   Gondola from Mountain Base to Mountain Top takes 20 minutes to the summit. Don't think of a gondola as a simple means of transportation. It is also a moving observatory. Skiing, Gangwon Land and Baekdudaegan are spread under your feet while riding the gondola. The slopes on the ski slopes are filled with summer wildflowers such as daisies and lions. The ridges of Baekdudaegan are pushed like waves to create spectacular scenery. You can enjoy the scenery from the gondola that you can't see without climbing the high mountains.

    Once you've climbed the mountain top, you don't have to head straight to Untan Altitude. Surrounded by a rustic colony of wildflowers. A shy flower blooms in the wind and sends out a gesture of temptation. The mountain trails behind the wildflower community make it a mountain country.
    <br/>
    There is more to see. High1 Alpine Botanical Garden is located at the top of the mountain at 1380m above sea level. In the highest botanical garden in Korea, 330 species of alpine plants are classified into themes such as Manbyeongwon, Alpine Grass Garden, Rock Garden, Sink Garden, and Wildflower Garden.

From here, take the road to High1 Hotel, Manhangjae. It's a bit uphill, but the road is flat and smooth, making walking easy. Taebaek's spirits take off while walking for two and a half hours.

   As it is the only mountain in Korea, it is a mountain path that leads to highlands and ridges that are more than 1,000 meters above sea level. The reason why Untan Altitude is special is that the beautiful landscape contains the history of the coal industry. The old road that carried coal. When the Hambaek Station was opened in 1957, about 2000 construction workers made shovels and pickaxes to transport coal.
