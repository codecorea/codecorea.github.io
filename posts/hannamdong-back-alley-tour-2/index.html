    The characteristic of the shops that entered Usadanro is the creative space that made the old buildings with minimal remodeling. So some shops use old signs to confuse visitors. Nevertheless, due to the affection and passion of young artists and entrepreneurs, Usadan Street, which can turn into an unsafe crime alley, is transformed into an art creative street, and the streets of young people representing Seoul following Hongdae, Garosu-gil, etc. It is transformed into.

Sometimes, things name people. We name things that already have names. Now, this could be the only name. ” “A person has a name, and sometimes things name a person. Even when there is a name for things, people call it again. ” In addition, I remember the title of poet Lee Kyung-ok's collection of poetry `` Road makes a way by walking.
