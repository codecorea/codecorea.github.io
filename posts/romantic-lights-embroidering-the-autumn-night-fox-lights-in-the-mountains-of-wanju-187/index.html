   Thanks to the fox in the novel 《The Little Prince》, the name ‘San Fox in the Mountains’ was added to the light festival that colored the night. It is a setting in which the fox who meets again in the dream of the little prince tells a story about him.

   That doesn't mean that there are fox or young prince sculptures. The storyboards are installed everywhere with pictures. If you don't pay attention to the story board, you don't have to install any lights. There are also impressive passages from the novel, and advice to cherish this time. There is no fox, but you can enjoy the beautiful fox color by recalling the scene in the novel.

The contents of the performance are different every time. Mostly, there are stages for amateur singers and bands active in the region as music performances. Sometimes the surprise proposals of lovers are held before or after the performance. If you are a couple considering a special event, please take courage to apply.

   If you follow the rosy side of the theater, you will see the rose garden. It is a fantastic place with tens of thousands of roses in full bloom. Compared to other light festivals, the overall lighting decoration is rather modest, but thanks to the rose garden here, it is more impressive. Roses are not flowers, but harmony. A wire was connected to the stem to make the buds light up. At first glance, there are quite a few who are trying to break it because it is like a flower. It looks more plausible because it has two buds and a blooming rose. Roses that glow white, yellow, or pink spread out like a carpet and are beautiful.

Moonlight Garden is better to see when there is sunlight before it gets dark. Flowers bloom every season, and various kinds of herbs are planted to make them fragrant. Fox lights in the mountains are open all year round, and the summer season (May-October) lights up at 6 PM and can be seen until 12 PM (last admission at 11:00). During the winter season (November-April), lighting is faster by 1 hour, and is available from 5 PM to 12 PM (last admission is 11 PM).

   Even if time is early on the way to the fox in the mountains, it is good to eat dinner beforehand. This is because there is only one restaurant in the festival hall and only a few snacks. It is a 15-minute drive from Bongdong-eup to Hiljo Town, so it is perfect to eat at Bongdong. Located on the other side of the Bongdong Nonghyup, “The Three Grandmothers Noodle Collection” is a place that has delighted people with delicious noodles for over 60 years.

   There is only one menu, noodles. This is done by adding noodles to the broth, which has a deep rich taste and a refreshing taste, and sprinkle with red pepper powder on the onion. There is no common Zidane or Cucumber, but the chopsticks are delicious enough to be busy. Quickly empty a bowl and make the soup clean even though it is full of pears. It is very simple to put on top of noodles such as kimchi, kkakdugi, cheonyang pepper, and sweet radish. It is divided into large / medium / small depending on the quantity, and the price is also low at 5,000 won / 4,000 won / 3,500 won each. If you order ‘Medium’ for an adult male or ‘Small’ for a female, it is a quantity that can be left slightly due to the stomach. It's not splendid, but it's not special, but it has many long-standing regulars and a lot of people who come and eat it on purpose.
