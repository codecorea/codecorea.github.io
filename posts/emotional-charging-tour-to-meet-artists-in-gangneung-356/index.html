   The role of Shinsaimdang plays a large role in making Gangneung a place of culture and art. Looking around Ojukheon and Yulgok Memorial Hall, I am glad to discover Shinsaimdang, an artist who is superior to Yulgok's mother, Sinsaimdang. If you continue to Gangneung Creative Artist Village and Oriental Embroidery Museum located on the side of Ojukheon, you will meet artists of the past and today, and you will be imbued with artistic sensibility.

   Yongin Lee's mother, Yongin Lee, had only five daughters, and her second daughter, Shinsaimdang, married her mother even after her marriage. As Shinsaimdang died in her husband's place, Pyeongan-do, Yulgok took over his mother's maternal grandmother. Yongin Lee inherited Seoul's tiled house and full answer to Yulgok teacher as a legacy, and gave Oh Jok-heon and full answer to another grandson, Kwon Cheo-gyun. After seeing the black bamboo trees that formed the forest around the house, Kwon Cheo-gyun called his name Ojukheon, and later became the name of the house.

   The 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics and Gangneung were held on ice. There is a Gangneung Olympic Museum near Gyeongpoho where you can feel the excitement of the last Pyeongchang Olympics again. The exhibition hall, composed of five themes, recycles used containers to capture the meaning of the Environment Olympics. The container is painted in blue, red, yellow, green, and black in accordance with the color of the five-wheel mark, and is lightly bright.

   At the 4D Experience Center, you can watch videos by selecting a few of the events such as ski jumping, bobsleigh, snowboarding, and alpine skiing. When the ski lands on the slope, the chair shakes and feels the wind, creating an illusion that you are actually playing. Experience the ski jump in VR (virtual reality), and it is also vividly unfolded in front of you. The facility is also fun, allowing visitors to experience curling matches by throwing stones. There are many things to see, including Gyeongpo Aquarium, Gangneung Green City Experience Center, and Heo Gyun and Heonan Seolsaeng Birthplace.

    The representative food of Gangneung is Chodang Sundubu. There is the birthplace of Heo Gyun and Henan Seolheon near Gyeongpoho. Heo Gyun's father's call was Chodang, so I guess the place originated there. In Chodang Village, there are about 30 restaurants that make tofu directly from generation to generation. Clean seawater is used as a gansu, but the taste of tofu varies slightly from house to house. The soft and tofu of tofu is simmered so as not to harm the original taste. The taste that goes smoothly without chewing is the lightness itself. If it's fresh, you can mix it with the seasoning. A bowl of tofu is perfect for children who don't eat spicy and spicy food for a meal.

    The Charmsori Gramophone &amp; Edison Science Museum is a collection of representative inventions of the phonograph and Edison. It has more Edison phonographs than the Edison Museum in the United States. Of the 4,000 phonographs made in over 30 countries, 3,500, 150,000 records, and 5,000 music-related books are packed with music, so it's hard to see which one is important. You can look around individually, but it is much more enjoyable to listen to the exhibition commentary as the professional staff will tell you about the exhibits and episodes.

A trumpet gramophone with a large trumpet shaped like a flower is often associated with a phonograph.

   The Edison Science Museum is a collection of exhibitions on light, collections on sound, and household items and inventions. After many trials and errors, Edison's light bulb is one of the most important inventions in human history. The number of light bulbs on display, including the first carbon light bulbs, is about 500. Without Edison, housework would have been much more intense than it is now. Coffee pots, toasters, waffles, ovens, irons, sewing machines, mixers, microwave ovens, and hair dryers are said to have been invented by Edison for his wife. The end of the tour ends with sitting in comfortable seats and listening to beautiful music. In the building next door, there is Son Sung-mok Movie, Radio, and TV Museum with a variety of movie-related collections.

   First look around the relics exhibition hall. More than 300 valuable artifacts that were collected in the mission field or used in daily life are displayed. Among the stately buildings, the Pirate Party with an exotic terrace in front was the main residence of the missionary male master. The terrace was given as a gift from the Russian construction. When you pass the wide lawn in front of the mission field, you can see the square pond and the bower Jeongnaejeong standing on the bridge at the entrance. It is especially worth seeing in the summer when the lotus is in full bloom, but it is a space that can be enjoyed at any time of the year. The style of old scholars who would have read a book alone or called a friend to pour a drink is reminiscent of itself.
