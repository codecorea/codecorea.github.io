   Metasequoia Road Memories
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   After passing through Hakyeoul Station and entering the Metasequoia Road, the scenery in memory begins to revive. Metasequoia trees are planted along Yangjaecheonro for about 30 years. It's not an exact memory, but it was about a few years since I planted the trees when I first passed this road. It was not planted all at once, but it seems to have been planted over several times by dividing the section. At first, I thought it was strange to see straight, thin trees lined up. I didn't even know what a metasequoia tree was, and I didn't even think it was pretty when I saw it straight out.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   At the time, it was a time when apartments were in full swing in either Daechi-dong or Gaepo-dong, but the square buildings and trees were not in harmony and dimmed. At least it looked like that to my eyes. By the way, is the power of the years great? Thirty years have passed, and the thin, unsightly trees grow thick and rich, and they blend well with the surrounding landscape. The trees have grown to be balanced without losing the strength of the apartment village.

   In particular, the trees near Yeongdong 4 and 3 after Yeongdong 5 are very worth seeing. The metasequoia of this section has a more abundant male shape and a thick base. Even among the trees, even the Dogok-dong residential complex, which soared into the sky next to it, is not visible.

   If you leave Garosu-gil for a while and descend to Yangjaecheon, you will meet a completely different landscape. Although the yellow color of the withered vegetation at the end of winter is unfortunate, it is a willow tree lined by the riverside, a mallard swimming on the water, and I want to see if it fits in the middle of Seoul. The huge building that rises above Metasequoia over the embankment feels like a mirage. It is a scene where the word ‘Sangjeonbyehae’ is a perfect match.

   Hagiya This area belonged to Gwangju-gun, Gyeonggi-do until the end of the Joseon Dynasty. As the city center in Seoul expanded, it was transferred to the Yeongdong branch, and in 1975, it was reorganized to Gangnam-gu, and Yangjaecheon was renovated, a road was created, and metasequoia was planted. In a short time, the change was enormous.

   Wine Street and Yangjae Citizen's Forest

   Metasequoia lined up on either side of the road as you pass through Yeongdong 3rd Bridge is planted on one side of Yangjaecheon. Instead, cafes with their own personalities on the other side face each other, facing each other. It is called 'Wine Street'. More than 20 bistros &amp; wine bars add another atmosphere to Metasequoia Garosugil.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   'Crossby', the oldest bar due to the excitement of wine streets, has maintained its place for 14 years. Places such as 'Ciel' and 'Miette' are also good for taking a break from tired steps. During the day, you can take out coffee and drinks and enjoy the leisurely sitting on the Yangjaecheon promenade or bench across the street.

   Male and female students are keen to learn skateboarding skills at the basketball court and playground under Yeongdong 2nd Bridge, passing by Gangnam-daero.

   In addition to the Yeongdong 2 Bridge, various sports equipment and amenities are provided under the bridges of the bridges over Yangjae Stream. There is a sledding area near Yeongdong 4 Bridge, so children can barely get tired of ice. However, this winter, because of the cold, the ice melted early, so it seems to be closed earlier than usual. On a sledding ground with a lot of water, a banner is hanging from the spring to turning it into a rice field and using it as a rice planting learning field.

   If you cross the stone bridge over Yangjaecheon River under Yeongdong Bridge 2, you will meet the Yangjae Citizen's Forest. Yangjae Citizen's Forest is a place to stay and rest if it is a resting place along the trail and bicycle path created along the Yangjae Stream. As it is still at the end of winter, you can only see yellow dry grass and bare trees, but soon spring will turn into a place full of greenness and richness.

   There is a swimming pool adjacent to Yangjaecheon, and it is large enough to operate volleyball and tennis courts as well as an outdoor barbecue in summer. However, Yangjae Citizen's Forest is not just a resting place. Located in the middle of the forest, Maeheon Memorial Hall is a place honoring the doctor of Maeheon Yun Bong-gil. I think that the spirit of Dr. Yun, who threw himself in the lunchbox and hungry for the death of a country craving for independence during the Japanese colonial period, resembles the metasequoia's weather.
