    Wando-gun. Is it because the island contains ‘島’. Wando is more popular with his islands than the main island itself. It's easy to think of Slow City's Cheongsan-do and Bogil-do, which bears alpine Yun Sun-do. To enter these two islands, you have to board a boat from Wando or the neighboring town of Haenam. As a result, even though they traveled to Wando, it is not uncommon for them to travel to the main island of Wando. That doesn't mean there's nothing to see on Wando Island. So today I prepared a round trip to Wando main island.

    Crossing Wando Bridge from Haenam and entering Wando land, it is Wando-eup. The Shinji Bridge, which connects Wando-eup and Sinjido, can be reached by road to Sinjido. Aiming to be completed in 2015, all islands including Gogeum, where the construction of the landing bridge is in full swing, as well as birthdays and weekdays, are all islands within the island. In addition to the main island of Wando, I also visited Myeongsasimni Beach, which Shinjido, which was connected by a landing bridge. Myeongsasimni Beach, which is a popular summer vacation destination, boasted a beautiful coast as its name.

   It runs about 10km along the 13th national road from Wando Bridge to reach Jangdo (Janggun Island) where the cleared ruins of Jangbogo, the sea king of Silla era, were found. Now, the wooden bridge can be placed at any time of the day, but in the past it was time to meet the water. Entering Jangdo Cheonghaeji (Historic No. 308), you can see the appearance of Cheonghae at that time by restoring the outer gate and introspection gate.

    Here are a few things you need to know to enrich your trip to Wando. Born in Wando, it is a general named Jang Bogo. One thousand years ago, Cheonghae, which seized the East Asian maritime rights from Silla, China, Japan, and Southwest Asia, was located in Wando, and Jangbogo was at the center.

    Myeongsasimni Beach, which means 'the sound of sand crying across the streets.' Fine sand shines in the light. With its fine sand and shallow water, it is a popular space for family vacationers. Children dressed in short sleeves are playing in the water. There are plenty of places to take care of accommodation, including pensions, campsites and restaurants. There is also a convenience store near the parking lot, so there is no difficulty to have a neck or snack.

    After returning to the main island of Wando again, run south to reach Mongdol Beach Gugyeung (Scenic Spot No. 3). 'The stones form nine steps' are filled with mondols of various sizes, ranging from small chestnuts to dinosaurs. It is a viewpoint that is considered a sunset point. Occasionally there are tourists trying to take them against Mondol, which is difficult. A 'place in place' campaign is underway.

    If you have seen the old seasons, head to the Cheonghaepo-gu shooting site. Cheonghae Pogu filming site in the small pogu is a place where the drama 'Haesin' and 'Jeongjeon', as well as the recently released &lt;Myeongnyang&gt; were filmed. Buildings such as pier, muzzles, ships and other objectives, buildings, dungeons, military barracks, and watchtowers are located. It is also considered a sunset point. It takes about 40 minutes to see it. If you like movies and dramas, you can add fun to the shooting location. There is also a shop where you can have light food and snacks inside. There is no General Bogo, who may have been here someday, but the waterway he looked at still holds its place.
