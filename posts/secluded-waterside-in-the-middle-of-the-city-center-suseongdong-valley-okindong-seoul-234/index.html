   In the middle of Seoul, there is a secluded valley at the foot of Inwangsan. There are not many people, but there are those that support Inwangsan Mountain. Suseong-dong Valley, which also appeared in &lt;Jangdong-pal Hinges&gt; by Joong-jae Jeong, has come to us in a form almost identical to that of the Joseon Dynasty.

   The valley called Suseong-dong Valley became famous because of the loud valley water. It wasn't until July 2011 that we revealed the hidden image to us.

   In particular, the fact that the Giraffe bridge, which is about 1.5m in length, placed at the beginning of the valley is almost similar to the painting of Gyeomjae, attracted attention. Giraffe is the only stone bridge preserved in its original form in the city, and it is interesting to note that it is made of stone.

   Chusa Kim Jeong-hee wrote the poem &lt;Watching a Waterfall in the middle of Suseong-dong&gt; against the backdrop of the Suseong-dong Valley.

   However, the Suseongdong Valley has a fatal weakness. The point is that it is difficult to see the valley water normally. Even though it has been raining for several days, the waterway quickly disappears. So, you should go to the rainy day or the day after it rains so that you can enjoy the scenery of the Suseongdong Valley properly.

   At the top of the valley, pine trees, walnut trees, hawthorn trees, and arrow trees form a lush forest, exuding fresh energy. Since the mountain is not deep, you can see the cool stream only after it is raining in general, but if you look carefully, you can still find a place to soak your feet quietly. It is a secret waterside like a secret garden. It is said to be a salamander habitat, so it is hard to say how clear the water is. The promenade around Suseong-dong Valley is well maintained, and is used as a resting place for nearby residents.

   The park surrounding the Suseongdong Valley is compact. In 10-15 minutes, you can take a round. It looks like a recently created park, but it is a pity because it feels somewhat artificial. Nevertheless, there are traces of the efforts to preserve the old appearance by exposing the rock of the valley as much as possible at the time of restoration. It is not a pleasure to be able to meet the valley of the Joseon Dynasty in the place where the old apartment disappeared. After all, forest is better than buildings, and nature is better than man-made.

   Climb up to the top of the valley to meet the Skyway of Inwangsan. If you cross one of the main roads, you will be connected to the Inwangsan Trail, and if you walk along the Skyway, you will pass through one sperm and lead to Buam-dong's “Poet's Hill”. It is also a good idea to walk along the road to Seoul Castle.
