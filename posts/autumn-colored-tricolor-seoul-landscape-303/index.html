There are many ginkgo trees in Seoul, but most of them are Garosu-gil, which is lined with two lines. However, Ginkgo biloba in Seoul Forest formed a colony in one place.

   There is a wave of yellow and red autumn leaves all over the mountain road, which is 100 m from there. People who stopped walking while taking pictures fill the road. Mountain roads are also stagnant. After the colors of the leaves are carved on the whole body, people begin to walk step by step. Dirt roads, stone roads, and wooden stairs repeatedly appear without steep climbs. A wooden table and a chair were placed in a wide area under the shade of a tree. It may be an implied middle shelter. Many people sit around and relax or eat food. “Sammaksa 1.8km” was written on the milestone. Now it's over half a bit.

    When they arrive, Sammaksa is crowded with people. Sammaksa Temple originated from the excitement of Wonhyo, costumes, and Yoonpil in the 17th year of King Munmu of Silla (677). After that, Dosunguksa Temple enshrined the Buddha and named it Gwaneumsa. After Ambassador Muhak of Joseon Dynasty resigned the temple, he acted as a treasure trove to the south of Hanyang. In modern times, Ji Seok-young, who practiced the Jongdu Act, built and built Baekryeonam. There is still a turtle 'gu' that was engraved when the operation was retired. There is also a three-story stone pagoda known to have been built to commemorate the killing of the leader Salitai in the battle of Incheongseong, Yongin, the monk of this temple during the war against Mongolia during the Goryeo Dynasty.
