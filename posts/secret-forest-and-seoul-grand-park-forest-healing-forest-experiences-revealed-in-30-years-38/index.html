   'Hot' is not enough weather. There was a news about the "secret forest" that appeared in the world in 30 years, when it was just breathing in the hot sun as if it burned everything.

   According to the guide, the journey time to walk, elephant train or forest healing forest is similar to 40 minutes. If you are riding an elephant train, you only need to move one stop and get off at the main entrance to the zoo and walk toward the Museum of Modern Art. Instead of entering the Museum of Modern Art, if you go straight down the main road, you will see an orange signage indicating the way to the Forest Healing Forest. From now on it is mountain climbing. The orange ribbon will guide you kindly.

   Although it is temporary, a 10m high waterfall welcomes the participants. Soak your feet in the valley that runs from the Cheonggye Mountain Valley and take a rest while looking at the waterfall. Take a picture with a waterfall in the background to cool down and go back. Sunlight does not leak in midsummer, so it is not sick. In the relaxation tree filled with firs, the healing meditation 'rest meditation' takes place. Rest on a wooden deck or floor here. Forest healers hand out the mattresses one by one. Lying comfortably in the sound of cicadas, the sunshine leaking through the vivid green leaves, and the fresh air provided by the trees. All the worries and troubles are laid down and Orot comes out with me. It's not long, but the effect is quite good. It takes you through the fragrant forest path where fragrant herbs greet you with a light step.
