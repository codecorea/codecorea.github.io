   If you go out to Changnyeong IC on Buinland Expressway, Mt. Hwangwang stands out from the wide open Changnyeong-eup. In the Three Kingdoms era, it was called non-military army and Hwawang-gun. Changnyeong, based on the Visage Army of the Three Kingdoms Period, is called Bisabeul, meaning “red field.”

   It is good to meet cultural heritage one by one, but it is also recommended to walk the 'Jungheung Wanghaengcha-gil' and 'Songhyuni-gil', which are built around the cultural heritage of Changnyeong-eup. The Jinheung Wanghaeng-gil road is centered on the Jinheung Wangcheok Guard and the distance of travel is about 7km. Songhyeon Yi-gil is a way to get into the story of a Gaya girl 1,500 years ago, the owner of Sunjang Ingol, excavated at Songhyeon-dong Tombs. It was discovered in Song Hyun-ri, so the girl was given the name 'Song Hyun-i', and Gil followed the name. Songhyeon Lee's moving distance is about 4 km. Although the two roads overlap each other, it is perfect for enjoying cultural heritage exploration while walking in the small town of Changnyeong.

   The two three-storied pagoda is divided into the east and the west of the Sulgori. Both are stone pagodas of the Unified Silla period, but they differ in many ways. The East Three-storied Pagoda is designated National Treasure No. 34, and the West Three-storied Pagoda is Treasure No. 520. The Dongsam Three-storied pagoda is a bit large, and the form and appearance of the pagoda are generally similar. The Dongsam Three-storied Pagoda has a sense of stability, sharp lines, and refined feeling. In comparison, the West Three-storied pagoda is a bit slender, and the lines are blunt and soft. West Three Storey Stone Pagoda can be met by following a narrow road to Namjung Park, while the East Three Storey Stone Pagoda is easy to find Changnyeong Public Market.

   When you exit Changnyeong Permanent Market and turn right along Myeongdeok-ro, you will meet Changnyeong Seok Bingo, a masterpiece of Joseon Dynasty. Seokbingo is an ice warehouse that was built during the Joseon Dynasty. The movie 'Gone with the Wind,' starring Cha Tae-hyun, which was released in 2012, was based on Servingo, a stone ice bin of Hanyang in the Joseon Dynasty. Seokbingo is also located in Gyeongju, Andong, Qingdao, and Dalseong. There are two Seokbingo in Changnyeong-eup and Yeongsan-myeon. Changnyeong Seokbingo was designated Treasure No. 310.

   National highway No. 20, which runs through the town of Changnyeong, crosses the Qingdao to the north and the Nakdong River to the south, leading to the Rural Land. Gyodong Tombs are located near the national road from Cheongdo to Cheongdo and Songhyeondong Tombs are near Changhwasa at the entrance of Hwawangsan County Park. Two burial mounds were grouped together and designated Historic Site No. 514. Gyodong and Songhyeon-dong burial mounds were formed in the 5th and 6th centuries, and are traces of the non-gagaya who developed their forces around the non-professionals. According to Samguk-yusa, built by the Goryeo Dynasty, non-gagaya was included in the 5-gaya along with the Gwan-gwan-gaya, the elderly, the Aragaya, and the Seongsan-gaya.

   Gyodong and Songhyeon-dong burial mounds formed over 150 mounds before the Japanese colonial rule. Excavations were made in 1918, during the Japanese colonial rule, when a huge relic was excavated. However, most of the artifacts were taken to Japan, and tombs were thoroughly destroyed.

In the burial mound, only traces of grave robbers remained, and when they were removed, four bones were found along with various ornaments and earthenware.

   Jinheung King is the king who expanded the territory of the Silla era the most. As he pioneered the territory, the pure rains that he set up in each region remain in Mt. Bukhan, Maun-ryeong, Hwangcho-ryeong, and in Changnyeong, there is a guard for Jinheung Wangcheok. Chuck Kyung-bi refers to the rain that was made in commemoration of public sentiment by patrolling the land after King Jinheung pioneered the territory. Another pure rain built in the Jinheung Wangdae has a title of 'Pure Water Pavilion (巡狩 管 境)'. It is a monument that was built after the king patrolled by the king, and the list of the servants who performed the king is engraved. Whether it is a steal guard or a pure expense, it is clear that this is evidence of the expansion of King Chin's territory.

In Manokjeong Park, there is also a selection fee for Chosonhwabi, which was built during Heungseondaewon-gun, and the three-storied pagoda of Tokcheon-ri, Changnyeongsa, and officials of Joseon dynasty who passed through Changnyeong.
