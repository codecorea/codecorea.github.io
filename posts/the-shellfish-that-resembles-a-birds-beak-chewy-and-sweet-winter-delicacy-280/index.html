    Winter is a delicious season. Although it seems relatively weak due to the richness of autumn and the scent of spring, there are many delicacies that can only be tasted in winter. The frozen river stalks are smelt, wild, and trout, and the salty waterfront offers oysters and fish filled with snow crab and guamegi. This winter, overflowing with delicious food, the 'flavor' of traveling is cold even on cold days. Gilson's worries are gathered in one way in the face of the true 'Gourmet Season'. Go where you go and taste something!

    Under the premise that there is no difference in 'taste', let's prepare a winter gourmet trip. It is cold, so I wish I could do it on a day trip. First, whether it's fresh or salty, that's the problem. The fresh water is good, but I decided to choose the beach in anticipation that the food would be richer in salty water. Why is the winter sea so attractive to people on land? First, I plan to taste the chewy winter sea and shoot the sea breeze in my body and mind, which I finally put on my lower neck. Now, let's go to the delicious beach where you can take a day trip!

    The Korean Peninsula, with three sides in the sea. Today's destination is Namdang Port in Hongseong, South Chungcheong Province. It is a prosperous town that offers a variety of foods in each season because it touches Cheonsu Bay, which is dug deeply between Anmyeondo and Cheon. Before the new clam season begins, in the fall, people who want to taste Daeha, trout, and blue crabs are gathered.

    Take the West Coast Expressway to Hongseong IC and run for 20 minutes to reach Namdang Port. It is a delicious port where 'festivals', featuring local seasonal food as the main character, unfold every season. During this cold windy season, the main character of the Namdang Port Winter Festival is the new clam. The Hongseong Namdang Port Bird Clam Festival, which marks its 10th anniversary this year, will be held until March 31. This year, the catch was reduced due to the cold, and the price increased, but there are still many who are looking for a fresh clam in the mountains.

   Let's take a look around Namdang Port for a while before going on a full-scale bird clam tour. A beach that, like any coast of the Southwest Sea, reveals a sensual feeling depending on the tide, and hides it with seawater. Far away, some fishing boats are slumbering with the sea breeze over the tidal flats that shyly exposed even the breakwater. Soaking in the peaceful view of the West Sea is a short while, and the path continues to the exciting new cockle festival.

   Dozens of stalls are lined up around the Namdang Marine and Fisheries Complex, which is scheduled to open in March. Like a food festival, the atmosphere is exciting. The hula hoop competition is taking place on the outdoor stage because it is a weekend, but there are more people filling the stalls than the stage. Where to enter? The prices are all the same, so you can just go where you like it.

   Let's take a moment to look at his identity before tasting the cockle. It is often said that it resembles a bird's beak, but it is said that it is said that swimming in the water is as fast as a bird. Unfortunately, this part has not been confirmed. All the new clams that I met at the Namdang Port were piled up in the barrel and kept in constant care. Still, the nature seems to be unusual. When I touched it, I aggressively squirreled the brown beak. It is your own body with a look, taste, and a tough personality.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Another reason to increase its value to the fullest is that it is impossible to form. A new clam that lives only in clean waters is taken out of the boat by scratching the floor with a mesh. It is a delicacy that goes hand in hand in many ways.

    Those who have tasted the chewy and sweet cockle, which has a distinct difference from other shellfish, will never forget it. It is the same reason that those who confront the cockle and flock to the Namdang Port in winter. It is popular as a diet food due to its low calorie and fat content as well as taste and aroma. It is also rich in essential amino acids, taurine and calcium. The explanation is enough now, so let's taste it.
