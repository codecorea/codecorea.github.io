   Maryang's history has a long history dating back to the Three Kingdoms period. Tamjin is Gangjin's old name. It was called Chonjinhyeon and changed to Gangjinhyeon during the Joseon Dynasty. Tamjin is the name given to the ship when it was built by the lion of Tamla, the island of Jeju, where the ship stayed at the oral cannon near Maryang Port. In short, Maryang was the gateway to maritime transportation to Tamla.

    Maryang Port was selected as the 'Fishing Area Complex Project for Fishing Villages' for the first time in the country in 2006. This project is to create a fishing port or a fishing port with a potential for tourism as a complex space. It deviates from the existing secluded port concept and seeks a multi-functional fishing port that harmonizes the fishing village's life, recreation, and tourism concepts. Maryang Port has a wide range of activities, including three breakwaters in East, China and China, a water threat market, and a marine product sales center. Also, there are about 20 sushi restaurants along the road, so it is perfect for tasting fresh fish.

From this point, the tidal flats and sea of Gangjin Bay unfold without filtration. The scenery of Gangjin Bay overlooking from the small pavilion on the right side of the ridge is quite quiet.

Of the eight islands in Gangjin, Gaudo is the only Yuin Island. A few years ago, a bridge was laid to stop the tourists on their way to Maryang. The 430 meter-long so-called 'Gaudo Chulleongdari' is a footbridge that cars cannot go through. After crossing this bridge and passing through the forest, you will find Gaudo Village, where 13 families gather. It is quite exciting to say that there is another rocking bridge from Gaudo to Mankho village across the sea.
