   Korea's first relip museum, pony museum
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The pony museum, also introduced in Prof. Hong-joon Yoo's “My Cultural Heritage Survey: Jeju”, was built and operated directly by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in the village of Kashiri, and has a meaningful title as the nation's first re-lip museum. The Lipe Museum is never a place to take a look around. It is a unique exterior that stands out from a distance, and various facilities create a unique sense of homogeneity with the surrounding environment, giving it a more stylish and harmonious feeling. In particular, the achromatic circular building modeled after the ascension causes more curiosity to see what is inside.

Although it is not large, you can find yourself becoming an 'Jejuma' expert by looking at each of the displayed panels. Jeju horse is the official name of the native pony of Jeju. In the past, it has been called under various names such as guama, a horse, a native horse, and a Jeju native horse because it passes under a fruit tree.

   The end of the exhibition leads to the roof garden on the third floor. When you climb here, the surrounding landscape spreads out like a 360-degree panorama, with wide grasslands and raised convex, sparsely visible pine trees (stone walls for ranch borders) and huge wind farms. In clear weather, you can clearly see the sea south of Seogwipo and Mt. Halla. Slowly walk through the roof garden and take in the fantastic scenery created by nature in your eyes and mind. It will provide wonderful memories that you will never forget.

   Let's ride a real horse now! Follow Rain Horseriding Course
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Now that you've studied hard on horses, it's time to go to practice. In the pony experience park, there is a horseback riding course where you can ride on the open meadow. The village ranch where the Dalbybi Horseriding Course was established was the site of the Gapjang, where the best horses have been raised since the Joseon Dynasty. Here you can experience horse riding while interacting with horses. The horseback riding experience is divided into a basic course (approximately 1.2 km), a meadow course (approximately 2.5 km, and approximately 3.5 km), and an outing course (approximately 13 km) around the track. The price ranges from 10,000 to 100,000 won.

   Overnight in the meadow, Ger Guest House &amp; Pony Camping
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   If you want to experience one night on the meadow, we recommend staying at the Ger Guest House. As if you were in Mongolia, there are four mongolian round tent houses side by side on the grassland next to the museum. Ger is an eco-friendly house that is cool in summer and warm in winter, making it a perfect accommodation for pony experience parks. In particular, the starry night sky, like a star is pouring, will make any luxurious clothing soft. The sound of grassworms coming from far away in silence and the sound of a horse's hoof passing through the door in the early morning makes you feel many times more real. The ger village consisted of 1 bed (4 single beds) and 3 ondol-type standing rooms (8 adults, 14 to 18 children).

   If you are a camper, you can use the camping site created next to Ger Village. The pony camping site is equipped with various facilities such as a sink, a restaurant, and a shower, so that not only a professional camper but also a beginner can enjoy nature together. All camping equipment can be rented on request. It is a beautiful space facing nature just one step away. At night, how about sharing a bonfire with family, lovers, and friends, and sitting around with a fire and sharing stories that you haven't been able to share? Sometimes the event takes place on an outdoor stage with lighting facilities, so it might be a good idea to check the schedule in advance. The camping fee is 15,000 won per seat per team, and the equipment rental fee is 60,000 to 100,000 won.

   I like it here too! Noksan-ro &amp; Daeroksan, Dalbioreum
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The pony experience park has many attractions to visit. Noksan-ro, adjacent to the park site, is a famous drive course that has been selected as one of the '100 best Korean roads'. In spring, yellow rapeseed flowers bloom on the side of the road, giving a bright spring outing. There are spots for parking on the side of the road, so you can take a commemorative photo at a place you like. At the site where the former Noksanjang was located, there was a braking ranch operated by Korean Air. It's okay to stop by at the Jeongsuk Airline nearby.
   <br/>
   Daeroksan (Great Deer Oreum) and Dalbi Oreum are places to miss. Especially in spring, the grassland under Daeroksan becomes a whole field of rapeseed flowers, and the yellow wave is spectacular every time the wind blows. Rapeseed flowers are held here every April. Dalbioreum is called 'Queen of Ascension' because it has several soft ridges. It is a good place to go anytime, but the autumn scenery with silver grass is particularly popular.
