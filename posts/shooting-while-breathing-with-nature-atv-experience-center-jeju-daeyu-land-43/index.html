   Pleasure to hit the flying disc! Clay shooting

    Daeyu Land is located in the middle mountainous area of Seogwipo City and is the only place where you can experience clay shooting in Jeju. In addition to the clay shooting range, which is made up of indoor and outdoor spaces, 330ha (about 1 million pyeong) of Jeju's nature, there are rifle, pistol shooting range, and ATV experience ground.

    bang! The sound is thrilling all over the body. The exhilarating energy of the air blows through the whole body at once. You haven't hit the target, but you will be happy regardless of your success. Follow the staff's instructions and shoulder the gun again. Second shot! The flying disc is hit by a bullet, split into two, and falls off without force. I am excited like children with more pleasure than before. I feel like old stress washed away at once. The first world of shooting is a series of curiosity and surprises. Once you have tasted clay shooting with nature, you have no choice but to fall in love with it.

    Clay shooting is a leisure sport in which clay disks are thrown into the air. Because you have to hit moving objects, you need a lot of quickness and concentration. Above all, the pleasure of hitting the flying disc is very exciting. Even beginners can learn without difficulty, so everyone can try it.

    Clay shooting uses a shotgun. With the buttocks on your shoulders, one hand holds the trigger side and the other hand supports the muzzle unsteadily. Shotguns are large and heavy and have a large recoil after shooting. Therefore, it is necessary to keep both feet firmly on the ground and posture before shooting. When the disc is slightly below the muzzle, firing increases the hit rate. Wearing earplugs is a must since the gunfire sounds very loud after launch. Shooting a total of 16 shots, of which only 5-7 hits are great skills. If you are confident in clay shooting, you can also go hunting for wild pheasants.
