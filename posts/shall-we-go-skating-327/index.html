    The Seoul Plaza skating rink, which has been loved as a winter playground and dating course for Seoul citizens, will open until February 23. Thanks to its location in the heart of the city, let's take a trip to the city center this winter along the Seoul Plaza skating rink, which can be connected to not only skates but also various date courses.

    On December 16, the Seoul Plaza skating rink, which celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, opened. The skating rink, which can be enjoyed at a reasonable price (1000 won per hour) at the center of the city, at Seoul Plaza, has been loved as a winter playground for citizens and as a date course. This winter, it will run for 70 days until February 23, commemorating the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Compared to the previous year, which closed in early February, the time to enjoy skating rinks has increased by about two weeks. In addition, a new skating rink for children has been set up so that children can use it more safely and comfortably.

   Even skating lessons are possible at an affordable price.

   Let's check the basics to properly use the Seoul Plaza skating rink. Opening hours are from 10 am to 9:30 pm, and Friday, Saturday and public holidays are open from 11 pm to 70 pm without a day off.

   One thing to remember is that during the 70-day open period, if the air quality index comes out as “bad,” the rink will stop operating after 2 hours. This is thanks to the air quality movement measurement equipment installed since this year. By measuring the air quality, we considered the health of those who use urban rinks.

    Not only that. There are toilets, book cafes, and luggage storage facilities, so anyone passing by the city hall can use the skating rink. The skating rink of the luxurious hotel skating rink overlooking the sparkling Christmas-decorated tree is not enviable. If you have time, you can also take a walk along Jeongdong-gil along the stone wall of Deoksugung Palace located across the street.

    Now, let's change the skates and climb on the ice rink. If you change your ice skates during the break to repair the ice plate and prepare for everything, you can enjoy skating for 1 hour. It is better to leave heavy luggage in the storage room and lift it gently. Before entering the skating rink, follow the instructions of the safety personnel to relax yourself with simple gymnastics. Ah, you must wear gloves. Without gloves, the entry itself is not possible. If you can't get it in advance, you can buy gloves inside the skating rink.

    From children who walk in hustle to lovers who hold hands, skaters enjoy bright expressions. There are many people who prepare tickets for several time periods at once because it is troublesome to book tickets by time zone at the ticket office. If you play at the skating rink all day, you will get used to it. At first, those who were tightly attached to the edge of the ice gradually advance to the center.

    If the basics of skating have been established when it is bright, it is time to enjoy the night view of the city after sunset. If you prepare a shawl or earmuffs for cold weather, you can enjoy the ice more leisurely. Winter in the city, surrounded by new light along with darkness, presents a different landscape. If you want to rest in a warm place while using the skating rink, you can enter the book cafe or gallery cafe in the booth of the skating rink. The Seoul City Hall Library in front is also fine. A variety of restaurants and cafés can be found all around, just a short walk away.

    If you are not afraid of the cold, you can cross the Deoksugung stone wall and walk a little, then go into your favorite tea house and melt. If you run out of hunger, head over to the famous Bossam restaurant, Gwanghwamun, and Myeongdong, which are located in Cheokcheok, and enjoy the food that suits your taste. It is also a good idea to see exhibitions at the Sejong Cultural Center, the City Museum, and the Daelim Museum.

   If you go out on a date with your lover, I recommend that you end up looking at the night view of Seoul from Namsan. You can take a cable car to the top of Namsan and climb the Namsan Seoul Tower to see the winter night in Seoul at a glance in a warm space. Thanks to foreign tourists, it is a bit difficult to go on a date, but you can enjoy a romantic date at a reasonable price.
