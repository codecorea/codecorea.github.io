   The traditional market slowly closes at 5pm. However, the win-win growth that has settled in the market starts to flourish from then on. I visited the 'community growth hall', a cultural complex that dreams of a marketplace where market merchants and young people coexist.

   There is a space that blends all of this, from food full of personality, to cold homemade beer to blow the heat into a room, and to a spacious rooftop overlooking Dongdaemun. It is also in the middle of the market! Sangsangjang, which has recently emerged as a hot place for Cheongnyangni, is located in Gyeongdong Market, a permanent market between Jegi-dong and Cheongnyangni, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul.

   Gyeongdong Market was originally a market where rural residents in Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do sold agricultural products, souvenirs, and specialty products. As the market grew, it became a traditional market of the same size. When you walk out of Cheongnyangni Station Exit 1 and walk about 200m, you will meet. Gyeongdong Market is home to a variety of agricultural products and fruitful fruits and vegetables. And nowadays, there is a win-win growth center, one of the best places in Cheongnyangni.

   Win-win growth is a compound word of 'win-win' to be together and 'jang' of the market to mean a coexisting space. The cultural complex space located in Gyeongdong Market began as a project to revitalize the traditional market. With the title of 'Win-Win Project', this place has been established as a space to attract young people to the traditional market.

   In the complex and lively market, the first feeling that entered another space for growth was 'unique'. I think there will be a place like this in the middle of the market! The coexistence center was originally left as a space used by market traders for a long time, but now it has become a lively and vibrant place through the hands of young people.

   The Win-Win Growth Center is open from Tuesday to Sunday except Monday. It is open from 5pm to 12pm on weekdays and from 12pm to 12pm on weekends. Is it because it is a space where young people and merchants in the traditional market come together, and there are various people who are looking for a win-win growth from merchants who stopped by to take a break to young friends who are dating.

   The size of the win-win market that uses the 2nd and 3rd floors of the market building is very large. On one side is a kitchen space where you can make food full of personality, on the other side is a space where people can enjoy food, and a space where works by various artists are displayed. It is more attractive because you can enjoy delicious food in a spacious and free space and enjoy various works.

   You can find a variety of menus with the personality of the young bosses in the coexistence area, and most of them are unusual menus such as 'Drop the Meat', 'Chicken and Waffles', 'Spinach Chili Pasta', and 'Spam Cheese Mousse Kimbab'. The menu is constantly changing, and the menu is selected and calculated at the counter located in the middle of the space. Beside the counter, you can enjoy homemade beer operated by a craft beer cooperative, and there are about 15 types of beer. You can enjoy fresh and unique beers such as 'Yuzu Ale', 'American Yellow Ale', and 'Alt Ale'.

   Healing time at the rooftop
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The 3rd floor is a highlight of the win-win growth and a rooftop overlooking the Gyeongdong Market. As a spacious space, the rooftop with a wide view is used as a concert hall for musicians, a talk concert hall for celebrities, a flea market, and an urban camping ground, and is a communication space for young people. At sunset, is there a better place than this to take a menu ordered on the second floor and bring it to the rooftop to gather together and enjoy a glass of beer? It is a win-win growth market that aims to reinvent the disappearing traditional market as a cultural space created by young people, while supporting the start-up of young people. The rediscovery of space is loved by many people and breathing new breath into the city.
