    Naju is a large flat area with a mountain facing the river. It is good to live in the beautiful Gangsan, so it is natural for people to gather. So many stories are piled up in Naju. The main story is about Naju-eupseong.

   'Wansacheon', a kind of water with willow leaves
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    I have a place to stop before entering Naju-eupseong. Headed to 'Wansacheon' where Wang Geon met a woman who fell in love at first sight. Before Wang Geon built Goryeo, he came to Naju as a general of the royal court to fight the dog. At a spring, a woman washing clothes asked for a bowl of water, and a willow leaf floated in the water that the woman passed. If you drink it in a hurry, you may pretend that it will float. This woman is the wife of Queen Oh. The background of this story is Wansacheon. It is also a historical point from the Three Kingdoms period to the Goryeo Dynasty and from ancient society to medieval society.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Goryeo's and Naju's deep relationship are conveyed in the sculptures of horseback Wang Geon and Queen Janghwa. 'Jeonrado' is a very important place since Naju, from the point of view that Goryeo Hyeonjong was named after the first ruler of Jeonju and Naju and the place where Hyeonjong escaped due to the invasion of Georan was Naju.

   'Najumok Cultural Center' at a glance telling the story of Najumok in 1000

  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    The words that often appear when talking about Naju are 'najumok', 'pastor' and 'moksagol'. You can check the importance of Naju at that time in the common 'Thu'. Mok is an administrative unit of Goryeo and Joseon Dynasty, similar to poetry and military of these days. In Jeonnam, Naju was designated as the only tree and served as the center of the economy, culture and military. Najumok, a story from 983 to 1895, is displayed in the Najumok Cultural Center for easy understanding.

    On one side of the cultural hall, a model of Naju-eupseong from the Joseon Dynasty is precisely made. In the Joseon Dynasty, there were many townspeople. According to Dongguk Yeojiram, there are 179 villages with towns and villages. Naju-eupseong began to be renovated and expanded in earnest as the Japanese invasion became frequent. By the time the construction was completed, it is estimated that the circumference of Naju-eupseong was about 3.5 km. If you look at the model of Naju-eupseong and draw a tour line around it, you can feel a greater impression while traveling. Don't forget to take a map at the tourist information center in front of the Cultural Center.

    At the center of the model is Naju Guest. It is also the next destination. The guest house in the Goryeo Dynasty was a facility where high-ranking people and foreign reaper could stay, but as the Joseon Dynasty passed, the local courthouse 'Chungcheong' was added to the guest house. A royal battle symbolizing the king was placed at the government office, and a recital was made to swear allegiance to the king. In addition, the king's notice was published in front of the government office, and when the king died, the people gathered in front of the government office and wept.

    Let's go to the pastor's house, 'My Pastor'. Get out of Manghwaru and pass 'Jungsuru', the gateway to Najumok Gwana on your right. There is a large drum on the second floor of the water tower. It is said that Hakbong Kim Sung-il, a pastor of Naju, walked the drum, saying, "Whoever wants to complain about a normal job, play this drum?"

Because of the large number of hospitality, the kitchen was wide. Currently, it is designated as a cultural property, so it is possible to experience accommodation, and there is a room named after Pastor Seong-il Kim, who learned from the story of Jeongsu-ru's drum.

    From Geumseonggwan, which symbolized the king, I went to Najuhyanggyo through the house where Pastor Naju stayed. As you move further away from the center of Eupseong, traces of ancestors with low status appear. In the town of Eupseong during the Joseon Dynasty, officials, people working in Gwana, and wealthy farmers could live. For the commoners, the castle was also a wall of identity that cannot be crossed. After Seoseongmun, I arrived at Najuhyanggyo outside the town.

    In the 11th year of Seongjong, Joseon, 10 students from Han Hyanggyo simultaneously suppressed the past. They were disciples of Na Joo Hyang-kyo's chilly Park Seong-geon. In addition, in the Goryeo and Joseon Dynasty, it was called the 'People's Treasure', where Naju's figures rise a lot in the office.

    The Najuhyanggyo Confucian School was said to have been established in the late Goryeo Dynasty, during the period of the 12th anniversary of the nation. Among the Hyanggyo, it shows the arrangement of Jeonmyo Huk (the space of the sacrifice and the space of the learning in the future). Among them, the Najuhyanggyo Daeseongjeon Hall attracts attention, and it is said that the walls were made of soil from Confucius' hometown, and it was said that this building was used as a specimen when rebuilding Sungkyunkwan, which was lost due to the Imjin War. Dong-jae and Seo-jae, who were studying while sleeping, are enormous. At that time, I can guess that there were many larvae studying at Najuhyanggyo.

Suddenly, Naju colored the heart with a wonderful hometown of the old days that was more friendly than the dignity of Geumseonggwan and the reputation of Najumok.
