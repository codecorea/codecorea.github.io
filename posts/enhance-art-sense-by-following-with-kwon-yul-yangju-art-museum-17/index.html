   Kwon Yul General is located just past the entrance of Jang Ukjin Museum of Art. General Kwon Yul is one of the masters who saved the country during the Imjin War. The dish towel that led to victory is considered to be the Three Great Battalion, along with the Pearl Battling and the Hansan Island Battling. While passing through Kwon Yul-ro, his head is bowed to the general spirit and national ideology of the general. As such, the trip to the Yangju Museum of Art is a trip with cultural heritage. If you include the Songam Space Center, it is a good study outing course that combines astronomical studies. Awaken the sense of art through art museum visits, creating a sense of empathy between parents and children, and enriching stories. So going out to three art galleries in Kwon Yul-ro is not a simple drive.

   Departing from Gupabal, Gisan Reservoir is the final destination and Jangheung Art Park is the first art space to meet at Kwon Yul-ro. It has been bent since it was renamed several times since its establishment. Total Art Museum was first established in 1984, but in 2005, it changed to Jangheung Art Park due to management problems. Later in 2006, Japanese designer and architect Shigeru Uchida designed Art Park and structural designer Van Shigeru designed the venue. In May of that year, an exhibition hall, atelier, performance hall, art gallery, sculpture park, and children's experience center were completed.

The name of this garden is Bourdel Garden. Sculptures by the sculptor Bourdel, such as Fruits, a Crouching Sacred Woman and Roman Mother and Child, expressing the love of mother and child, welcome visitors from all over the lawn. French sculptor Bourdel is one of the three greatest masters of modern sculpture, along with Rodin and Mayol.

   The Picasso Children's Art Museum is a must-see for adults. Although it is a replica, you can see the works and passionate lives of Picasso's soul (1881 ~ 1973) here. In particular, Picasso's photographs taken by photographer Andre Viller (1930 ~) are incredible, so they are more inspiring. The two first met in 1953. Since then, Biller has photographed many scenes, including Picasso's focus on his work and his thoughts. Picasso's passion in black and white photography and his desire for artistic life come alive.

   Just a little up from Jangheung Art Park towards Kwon Yul General Cemetery, Yangju Museum of Art is displayed. The museum was designed after Jang Uk-jin's tiger painting and was opened in April 2014 and won the Kim Soo-geun Architecture Award that year. It is a great pride to have a large collection of genuine artists. More than 230 pieces of murals, oil paintings, prints, ink paintings, etc. are donated by the Jang Uk-Jin Art and Culture Foundation to display them by theme and period.

   Painter Jang Uk-jin (1917 ~ 1990) is a master of Western painting that represents Korean modern art along with Park Soo-geun and Lee Joong-seop. Born in Yeong-gun, Chungcheongnam-do (now Sejong Special Self-Governing City), the story of his art museum entering Yangju was due to his studio in Deokso, once a land of Yangju County. Since then, he has continued his creative activities in the studios of Seoul Myeongryon-dong, Chungju Suanbo and Yongin Singal.

Created in 1964, the work description attached to the side tells the old story with black and white photography. Animal Family was painted on the wall of the studio in Deokso, Gyeonggi-do. The warm gaze of the painter can be felt in the artwork where cows, chickens, pigs and dogs are harmoniously drawn like a family. In particular, the real cowcoats and warangs are hung on the murals to evoke local sentiments.
