   If you solve the name Chuncheon in Korean, it becomes 'spring me'. It means 'the city where spring comes'. As its name suggests, the lake in Chuncheon, where spring comes, is beautiful, so it is bright. May, full of freshness, shines even more in Chuncheon. You can walk two feet along the calm lake, or you can ride a two-wheel bike. The path through the green, the whole body is full of freshness.

   Enjoy the beautiful and thrilling scenery, Skywalk
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   To fully enjoy the spring of Chuncheon, first walk along the lake shore. There is a bicycle trail and promenade around Chuncheon's representative lake, Uiam Lake. The road runs along the edge of Uiam Lake or over the lake. The scenery that blends the mountains and the lakes has created a new sight on this attractive road. This is the Skywalk Floating Observatory (Haneulgil), which opened last summer. Skywalk is installed in the Uiam Lake circulation bike course between Kim Yu-jeongmuninbi and Songam Sports Town. There are many people who ride bicycles as well as people who visit this place on a walking course.

   Skywalk can be entered from the former Gyeongchun-ro area where Kim Yu-jeong Moon is located and from Songam Sports Town, but it is closer to enter from the former Gyeongchun-ro area. When you go along the old Gyeongchun-ro toward Uiam Dam, you will see a restaurant called 'Daw sirloin'. Skywalk is close from here. However, it is recommended to park in Songam Sports Town if you are traveling by car, not by bicycle, because the parking lot is not properly equipped in the old Gyeongchun-ro area. If you park on the side of Songam Sports Town's Iam Ice Park, you can take a leisurely stroll around the water trails and skywalks.

   When you park your car at Uiam Ice Park, you can see the building of the 'Mul-gil' Secretariat where you can experience canoeing. If you have time, you can enjoy canoeing here. This is a course where you can feel the idyllic lake scenery up close. Swim on a lake in a wooden canoe. Fall into a different scenery than what you see on the promenade. Even if you can't enjoy the canoeing experience yourself, just watching the canoes floating around the lake is satisfactory.

   After passing the 4m wide and 10m long passage, a circular observation deck with a diameter of 10m appears. Both the aisle and the observation deck are made of tempered glass. The lake can be seen through the glass. Cool but dizzy. It doesn't seem like much, but there are a lot of people who hesitate in front of the passage. It is true that three steps of laminated glass are stacked and a special film is placed between them, so it is safe to take steps to guide the guide that it is safe.

   There is another walking course not to be missed around Uiam Lake. It is a road that leads from the waterside promenade of Gongjicheon Uiam Park to Chuncheon MBC and then to KT &amp; G Sangsangmadang Chuncheon.

   The walkway along the waterside in Uiam Park is also the 'Golden Scale Theme Street', which was created with the theme of the novel Golden Scale. In the middle of the promenade, sculptures related to artists other than the middle are installed. There are benches all over the place, so it's a good place for duck boats to relax while admiring the floating lake. People often spread their mats and rest in Uiam Park on one side of the promenade. You can easily find a bicycle rental shop near Gongjicheon, so you can ride a bicycle.

KT &amp; G Sangsang Madang Chuncheon was remodeled and opened in the spring of 2014. It retained the existing brick structure designed by architect Kim Su-geun, who is considered as a master of modern architecture in Korea. A butterfly-shaped building goes well with Uiamho. It has a wide lawn, so children can stop playing. You can use various facilities such as cafes, exhibition halls, and performance halls with outdoor terraces.
