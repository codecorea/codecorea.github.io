    The protein enzyme bath has an excellent effect on raising the body temperature. The body temperature of modern people suffering from chronic diseases with low body temperature is raised to 37 ~ 38 ℃. It is a natural treatment using cypress sawdust without the help of artificial heat such as electricity or gas. After 15 minutes of the enzyme enzyme bath, you will feel warm. As the body's temperature rises, the pores expand and enzymes penetrate into it, activating skin cells. Metabolism becomes active as warm energy spreads throughout the body. This is why it helps to improve the constitution of those who are obese.

    The bottom line is that the manuscript has always made my back harder. Perhaps because of the sweat from the bedrock bath, the skin is as smooth as the bath. I am suffering from varicose veins. Three times more money than jjimjilbang was not waste. In particular, the enzyme bath, which is excellent for women, was too hot to touch bare skin. I put a towel on my butt and sawed my toe with a sawdust.

   The protein enzyme bath is known as an alternative therapy for chemotherapy, female disease or inflammatory disease. Especially if you have an atopy or allergic disease, the cypress sawdust has a direct effect on your skin. Let the body cool down for a while after the enzyme bath. Then rub your whole body with some cypress sawdust. Massage your neck, back, legs and arms. For this purpose, it is better to find Cygwonwon in pairs of two. After the massage, rinse off with water only.
