   As the cultural complex is located on the high hill of Cheongpung Lake, there is a steep slope due to the geographical characteristics, so it is difficult to tour the entire cultural complex. You need help from an assistant to look around the Hanbyeokdang. Wheelchairs (3) and strollers (2) are available at the ticket office.

   This is a space where you can enjoy activities such as the country's largest bungee jump, cable coaster crossing the lake, and sports climbing. It is also a place where you can watch the beautiful sunset of Cheongpung Lake, called 'Inland Sea'. There is nothing to enjoy while riding in a wheelchair, but just looking out at the sea like Cheongpung Lake is attractive enough. The hydroponic fountain soaring to a height of 162m is impressive. The spring and autumn fountain operating hours are 11:00, 13:30, 15:00, 17:00, and 19:30. Unfortunately, from November to March of the following year, the fountain will be shut down to prevent freezing.
