    Corianders say. About ‘the taste of winter travel’. We, afraid of cold wind and cold, turn on the TV in the warm lower neck. This is because you can enjoy the winter scenery while watching KBS &lt;Day 1, 2 Days&gt;, which reached Season 3, and MBC's &lt;Daddy, Where&gt;, where you can see the cute little kids' growth. Sometimes I think of 'I'll go once' while watching delicious food or a great winter scenery. So I looked. Where are their favorite winter destinations?

    When did it start? On the ground TV, outdoor programs that claimed the 'wild variety show' appeared. There were often programs to introduce destinations as a vacation or holiday special. However, the background is the main character and the survivors of the broadcasters unfolding in this raw space came with a different fun in the name of 'wild variety'. There were a lot of broadcasts even if I added cable broadcasting, but this article will focus on KBS &lt;1 Night 2 Days&gt; which started in 2007 and MBC's &lt;Daddy, Where&gt;, which started in 2013.

   Travel season with no difference between low season and high season… Still, winter travel is difficult?

  <div class="txt_p">

    Viewers who laughed after watching their lives and playing games to sleep in a warm room in the cold of the cold were interested in the “space” where they headed and stayed. In the late 2000s, when the IMF (International Monetary Fund surge) began to take an interest in 'climbing', people became increasingly interested in professional equipment and the 'outdoor frenzy' hit the land. Nowadays, from middle and high school students to 20s and 30s, they use outdoor jackets for various ages, but even 10 years ago, if they were “climbing clothes,” they would be considered as “clothes worn by uncles”.

    Each traveler and every traveler has a style to pursue, but in general, it is not necessary to have detailed information when traveling by car to destination to enjoy the scenery and time there. However, as you travel, the moment comes when you want to jump directly into the picturesque landscape. I wondered when the sun was rising and where I was standing. If you look at &lt;1 Night 2 Days&gt; or &lt;Daddy, Where Going&gt;, you will have a blood clot over a place to sleep. During this process, viewers will naturally learn various information about the space. It is not related to the role of the exposed space at this time that people find their destination.

    The wild variety's most used formula is to let people in the game go to bed outdoors. Sleeping outdoors without a tent is called ‘bivouac’. It is usually a way for professional climbers to go to bed while barely avoiding wind while climbing. In other words, it means falling asleep with a blanket over the sky and a pillow over the ground. Of course, in the case of &lt;2 days and 1 night&gt; and &lt;Dad, where are you going&gt;, there were times when there were tents, but for those who have never done camping properly, it is no different from Bibak.

    Is it because of the definite prior learning produced as a 'video' about the destination? It seems that people no longer think of travel as difficult. Instead, I think that I can think of it as a familiar space that I already know, that I can leave at any time. Because I was exposed to advance information through a program aired on TV. I was curious to comment this long. What winter destinations were introduced through programs such as KBS &lt;1 Night 2 Days&gt; and MBC &lt;Daddy, Where Are You&gt;? Here are some of the wild variety's favorite winter destinations. &lt;Daddy, Go Where&gt;, which would have been of interest to families with children, added for a family trip.

   Outdoor sleeping is directly connected to camping. In order to enjoy camping, which is considered the best part of outdoor activities, you must basically enjoy traveling and go beyond the stage of enjoying the trip. This is because, even if it is a fixed time, it requires a little bit of pitting to stand up in nature. (Of course, some people start camping.)

   The real information that goes out into the mountains, fields and outdoors and hits it with my body is alive with information from camping and other outdoor activities. The wild variety such as &lt;2 days and 1 night&gt; met this process, that is, the process of "going to travel masters," which we had to go through, and people began to travel to find the destination introduced on TV. (This may mean that there was no travel guidebook that stimulated people's curiosity.)

   Let's take a look at MBC's &lt;Dad, Where I Go&gt;, which started in January 2013 and has a small amount of broadcasting. The first winter trip with young children was 'Oegeulgeori', an outback town in Chuncheon, Gangwon-do. The kid who still shed tears like chicken poop is still good for his eyes that he stayed overnight in the poorest house.

   The Chuncheon Lake, which was selected as a winter destination, showed a tent on a ice plate and catching a smelt. Every winter, the Sancheoneo Festival was held in Hwacheon, Gangwon-do, the Smelt Festival was held in Inje and Chuncheon, and the Trout Festival was held in Pyeongchang. In addition, Gangwon Jeongseon and Wondeokcheon Village and Dumori in Cheongwon, Chungbuk were introduced as winter destinations for Dad and Where. In addition, Jeju Island, a warm southern country, was selected as the last destination of Season 1.

    From now on, let's take a look at the region selected as a winter destination in &lt;2 days and 1 night&gt;. This winter, I went to the Namwon Snake Valley and the Gyeongbobi Ice Wall in Yangju, Gyeonggi Province. Of these, the place where winter color is properly revealed is the ice barrier. The appearance of an old actor who screamed in a whale watching a dolphin hanging over a rocky ice wall where people who enjoy extreme outdoor can enjoy “Ice Climbing”, which they will not forget in the winter, left a new laughter and a place in mind.

    In 2012, we visited Yanggu in Gangwon, Hwangtae village in Inje, Gyeongpodae beach and Buyeondong village in Odaesan. In addition, Hongseong in Chungnam, Gyeongsang area introduced Tongyeong and Pohang, Guryongpo, Jeonnam Jangheung, Seoul Gyeongbokgung and Jongmyo. In winter, how many people have not tasted it again after seeing Hwangtae-deokjang that fills the mountain valley of Gangwon-do? Gangwon-do, one of the most popular snow trekking spots in Daedae, and Tongyeong and Pohang, where delicious water and gwamegi await.

    Not only that. In 2011, Gangwon-do visited Cheorwon Mintong Line, Taebaeksan Mountain, Chuam · Gyeongpodae Beach in the East Sea, Garisan Natural Recreation Forest in Hongcheon, and Seoraksan Mountain. Introduced Gunsan Geumgang Lake in Jeonbuk, Boryeong Hodo in Chungnam, Tongyeong Retail Water and Ulleungdo in Gyeongsang area, Sonjukdo in Yeosu and Jeju Island in Jeonnam. In 2010, when there were many missions where members were torn apart, Incheon, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, and Gwangju were introduced, as well as Jeju, Gyeongbuk Andong, Jeonnam Sinan Heuksando, and Gyeonggi Gapyeong Calbongsan. Following 2008, which visited Nokdo and Oeyeondo in Haeram, Haenam, Jeollanam-do, and Yeonseongdo in Boryeong, Hwacheon, Gangwon Hwacheon, and Uljin and Jeonnam, Gyeongsangbuk-do, in 2009, in 2009, Gangwon Morning Garrigol, Jeonnam Yeosu Geomundo, Jeonnam Boseong, and Damyang left.

    The most introduced regions as winter destinations were the islands of Gangwon-do where you can enjoy both mountains and the sea, and the islands of the South and West Seas that can organize the year. Gangwon-do, which embraces the East Sea closest to the downtown area of the metropolitan area, has become a town that can be visited enough for a day trip in the “Maika” era. Where is summer only? In winter, it is overflowing with skiers at the foothills of Gangwon-do and visitors to the popular East Sea sea during the season. Gangwon-do, which has long been regarded as a barren land, has settled as a 'travel destination' with various images by maximizing the natural environment he embraced in the 21st century. The wild variety show did not miss his advantage. Why don't you take your own “wild variety” trip this weekend, a winter destination that has been steamed for a while?
