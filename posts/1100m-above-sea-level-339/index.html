    The clouds above the sky seem close to you. When the clouds become heavy, they sit down to the roof of the inhabited village. On some days, it seems like a cloud is falling over the valley and I am stepping on my feet. I walked in the clouds in the Anbandegi village of a plateau 1,100m above sea level.

  <div class="txt_p">
   By the time you arrive at the river, the clouds cover the sky. It is not a light cloud of clouds or a heavy cloud of clouds. These clouds are not easily removed. Like a stagnant highway, I head to the Anbande with a frustrated heart.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The Anbandegi belongs to Wangsan-myeon, Gangneung-si, but is closer to Hoenggye than downtown Gangneung. Even when using public transportation, it is better to go to Hoenggye and then take a taxi from Hoenggye. This is because there is no public transportation from Gangneung or Hoenggye to Anbande. City buses go from Gangneung to Daegi-ri three times a day, but after getting off the bus, you have to walk uphill for about an hour to get to Anbande.

   The winding path goes up to the Anbande Road. It seems that the clouds seen in the river are gathered in the bandage. Clouds obscure vision. The vision is blurred. You can see the sign “Café” at the entrance of Anbandegi. It is a place to eat cup noodles and simple drinks. In one side of the cafe, you can see photos of the life of people living in the Anpandegi area.

    The Yoke Observatory, where you can see the landscape of the Anbande Plateau, is hidden from the clouds. I couldn't see the cool scenery even when I climbed the observation deck, so I thought about just going back. I have decided to go up to the observation deck.
    <br/>
    The road up to the observatory was cut off by the clouds. When you go up one step at a time, the cloud recedes and releases the path. In the late heat, approaching 30 degrees, in short-sleeved shorts, the air here is cool. Small droplets in the clouds moisten the skin. The feeling of walking on the clouds at a plateau of 1,100m above sea level, which even feels cold, is different. You can see the city of Gangneung and the East Sea in the distance, but now the trees in front of you just look faint.

    Anbandegi is Daegiri in Wangsan-myeon, Gangneung-si in the administrative district. In the Joseon Dynasty 《Yeojido》, the name of Daegiri appears, but at that time, Daegiri belonged to Gujeong-myeon, Gangneung-gun. After the merger of 20 villages in 1916, during the Japanese colonial rule, it was named “Daegi-ri” and incorporated into Sanggu-myeon. Following the exemption reform in 1917, Sanggujeong-myeon was renamed Wangsan-myeon and became the jurisdiction of Wangsan-myeon.

    An area of 198 million square meters (about 600,000 pyeong) between Oknyeobong and Gorupogi Mountain is spread out in the shape of eagle wings. It is wide enough to be difficult to see at a glance. Anbandegi is a land that was allowed to be reclaimed from 1965 and leased to Hwajeon residents, and then sold to farmers in 1995. The highland vegetable cultivation only the nation's largest, which is currently 20 farmers live. In the early days, the settlers used bare stone fields with bare hands. I started by digging and removing the stones that came out every step. The cow was filial piety in a hillside where the machine could not even dream.

So the first half of travelers arrived from a yoke observatory It is like a stone wall walls made of stacked stones. The stone from the Anbandeian field was built with a huge stone wall. Where's it gone up the stairs was a dog a few wooden chairs and a gazebo. The clouds surrounding the son-in-law in a dizzying atmosphere seem to be holding your breath.

Hwajeon people who came to the mountainous plateau of the valley to eat and live. As the life that seemed achromatic inclined day by day, the flowers would have bloomed like that one afternoon in the distant autumn like today.
