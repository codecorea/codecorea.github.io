    Dessert, is there something sweeter and more tempting than this? A bitter black coffee and a dessert that was born in a natural way began to make a refreshing transformation with a beer and a meal instead of a meal. The five desserts I found on Itaewon's alleys are as delicious and lovely as the exotic. The power of a piece of dessert that blows away everyday stress in one room! Whispers secretly and sweetly despite the high calories and burdensome prices. It's okay, it's a dessert.

   When did we start eating sweet desserts after meals? In the era when a piece of cake was the best dessert, the dessert craze was popping out with a refreshing idea. The scent of baking cakes and pies in the alley of Itaewon, the center of desserts that can be called a light culture or a sweet luxury.

    When you go to Lady M, which opened in August of this year, you can meet three different types of crepe cakes made by stacking 20 layers of crepes. There are three types of cake: chocolate crepe, vanilla wheat crepe, and green tea crepe. Its taste is as soft and rich as a fresh cream that is soaked between 20 or more crepes.

    In addition to aging the basic ingredients for a day, crepe cakes that come out every morning insist on daily production sales because they have to go through tricky processes such as making cakes and refrigerating them for 12 hours. The crepe cake made by Patissier from New York is at the same height, and the thickness of the crepe is correct, as well as the amount of fresh cream. On the afternoon of the afternoon, you can add a sweet cake to a glass of beer like a New Yorker on the 3rd floor terrace where you can feel the atmosphere of the city.

    Cafe Frank, who is hiding in the alley of Gyeongnidan, feels relaxed even if he is always crowded with people. This is thanks to the green pots surrounding the cafe, dry flowers hanging from the indoor ceiling, and colorful desserts on the shelves. The rainbow cake of the seven colors of Pajuno Chopa is also famous, but the blue and white tart is also popular.

The seven colors are so vivid that it feels like a bad food, but thanks to the attractiveness of edible pigments that cannot be obtained with natural colors, it has captured the taste of young people.
