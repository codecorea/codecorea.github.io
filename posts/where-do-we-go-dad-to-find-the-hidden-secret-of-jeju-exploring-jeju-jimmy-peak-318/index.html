    Jimmy Bong that stands on the shore of Hadori Village in Gujwa-eup, Jeju. Jimmy Peak, also known as Jeju Island's end of the earth, is a superb view of Udo, Seongsan Ilchulbong, Migratory Birds, and Mt. Halla as well as the emerald sea. It is one of the most representative representatives of the eastern Jeju region. It was one of Jeju's hidden sights that only those who knew so far knew, but as it was included in the Olle 21 course, which opened last year, many people climbed the peaks along the Olle trail. In particular, &lt;Daddy! Where are you going?&gt; As the team visits Jimmy Bong, more travelers are just aiming for Jimmy Bong.

   Jimmy Bong, find the entrance!

  <div class="txt_p">
   &lt;Dad! Where are you going?&gt; Sung-joo Kim, the father of the team, visits Jimmy Bong with his son Min-guk. “I've arrived at the destination” looks around according to the navigation guide, but looks somewhat unpredictable. Obviously, Jimmy Bong can be seen nearby. Eventually, I come down the road where I came to the conclusion that it may not be this way.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Is this setting for fun broadcasting? Not like that. Jimmy Bong, like Min-guk and Dad, can't find the entrance easily, so there are quite a lot of travelers. &lt;Dad! After seeing Where?&gt;, Two female college students who put Jimmy Bong on a mandatory course during their trip to Jeju, wandered around the Udo Pier, where they can see Jimmy Bong.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Jimbong is close, but the entrance is not visible right away.”

    Many people who have come to Jimmy Bong, like Korea or two female college students, are often unable to find or pass through the entrance. If so, was the entrance hidden? That is never. When you find the entrance, you will often wander around close enough to make a nice laugh by saying ‘Aha ~!’ It is the easiest way to find the trail along the Olle Trail, but you can easily find the entrance by surprisingly skimming around the Jimbong.

    On the second day, this time, I joined the sisters I met during the trip, and once again, I challenged to find the entrance to Jimmy Bong. As I traced back the path I walked yesterday, the entrance reveals a pouting place where I said, 'It's not that way.'
   </p>
   <p>
    "haha! I couldn't see it yesterday, but ... ! ”
   </p>
   <p>
    As if trying to make up for yesterday's failure, the two friends, who burst into laughter with the party, take a light step first.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Beginning to climb Jimmy Bong, like a Korean, is just as enjoyable. As soon as I climbed it, I wondered if I had walked through a forest path with a cool shade of trees and a steep staircase appeared. The road to step by step is not green. Jimmy Bong is not a very high climb of 165m above sea level and 150m above sea level. However, due to the steep slope, you have to take some effort to reach the top.

    When the light steps felt a little heavy, it seemed like Sung-Ju Kim's voice was heard somewhere like a hallucinations.

    “… If it's hard ... You can give up ... ”

   <p>
    Kim Sung-joo, a father who talked tenderly to Min-guk, who was somewhat in trouble, seemingly unhappy. After that, Minkook stepped on the summit before his father, but he faced reality, so the summit is still far away.

    Ah, it's harder than I thought, but should I turn around or not? Shall we go a little further, go down, come again next time… All sorts of temptations and anguish disturb the mind and make the steps go back. The moment I look back on the road I've been up to now, let's take a break and say, "Oh!" The elasticity that pops out comes out. Everyone hardens like a stone. The landscape that was unimaginable before the climb was unfolding before your eyes.

    Unfortunately, it's time to go down Jimibong. Turn the steps that don't fall off and head down again. The steps are lighter than when climbing. If you're a bit unhappy, it's also an interesting trip to visit the scenery you saw in Oreum one after another. You can visit the nearest Hado migratory birds for a quiet time to ponder, or take a boat from Udang Wharf to enter Udo. Looking up at the peak of Seongsan Ilchulbong or another hill and looking at Jimmy Peak is another unique memory.
