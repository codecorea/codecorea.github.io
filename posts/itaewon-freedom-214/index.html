   There is no 'impossibility' in this place, where different races and cultures mediated by their food and fashion are continuously mixed to produce another culture. In Seoul, South Korea, I headed to Itaewon to see the infinite freedom and taste of the world.

   In college and vacation, there were motives for backpacking. They seemed to be 'freedom' themselves, leaving for adolescents who had to spend a vacation as a part-time job to save money for the next semester. It was also around that time that I dreamed of a wild dream of 'I'll see all the earth, water, and sky of the earth' through the wheels of reality. At the time, all I could do was lay out a map of the world and make a travel route, but even then, after looking around the globe a little, I felt like I wanted to leave anywhere.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Then one day, I realized the existence of 'he'. Itaewon, an island embraced by Seoul, Korea. It is said that there are more foreigners than Koreans, so you can enjoy food and culture from around the world as well as shopping, so you can enjoy the feeling of traveling abroad. Where else is this sweet temptation for a thirsty traveler? Eighty percent of the reason for leaving was to escape from reality and become a stranger. You can solve it with a single subway ticket. All you need is comfortable shoes and a map! Let's travel around the world in Itaewon, where you can reach right away whenever you want!

   Itaewon's Won originated from the fact that it was one of the four major stations for Hanyang travelers in early Chosun. It was a space from the beginning. In addition, during the Japanese colonial rule, the Japanese military headquarters entered, and after the Korean War, the US military base entered Yongsan and used 'Tarley Lee' and 'I-Ball Tae' to solve 'other children's neighborhoods'. did. The raw snags created by people being mingled and mingled are born as 'free space' that embraces 'time' and recognizes all kinds of 'diversity'.

   There are buses heading to Itaewon, but here, we will introduce them to subways that are easier to find. You can get off at Itaewon Station on Subway Line 6, or at Hangangjin Station or Noksapyeong Station. If you are going for the first route, it is better to depart from Exit 3 of Noksapyeong Station, which connects to Itaewon-daero. Itaewon-daero is the real name of the main road that stretched out to the center of Itaewon. Let's call it 'Itaewon main street' here. Arched sculptures welcome Itaewon.

   When you climb on the road, people of various skin colors appear in earnest. I'm looking at them walking comfortably in my salvation, so this is like a stranger. Where is this? Whose land is now walking on? But for a moment, as the nerves that became sensitive to various skin colors become more and more familiar, the song of UV that excited us some summer comes to mind. Itaewon Freedom, which is called in a space that allows infinite freedom that no one can interfere with!

   Things to see are split by the back. On the attached map of Itaewon, each street is labeled with a name. The street names may be slightly different, but it is unlikely that there will be a large crowd in conveying meaning by revealing the character in the name itself. Each street has its own characteristics, so you can choose according to your preference. It can be used for shopping and dining, and you can see even the 'Islamic culture', which is hard to find in the East.

   When you come out of Exit 3 of Noksapyeong Station on Subway Line 6, you can see &lt;Sujis&gt;, who had a brunch in Itaewon. This is the 2nd floor of the &lt;Hans Suit&gt; building on the map. Itaewon Main Street, which extends coolly to the center of Itaewon, is at the back of &lt;Itaewon Traditional Market&gt; at the beginning of 'Itaewon Traditional Market', and horizontally the 'Fashion Street' spreads. Fashion and miscellaneous goods stores, including &lt;Itaewon Underground Shopping Mall&gt;, introduced as a treasure trove of fashion experts. Of course, there are road shops on the main street of Itaewon.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   When you reach Itaewon Station along the main street, you can look around &lt;Hamilton Hotel&gt;. Behind &lt;Hamilton Hotel&gt; is 'World Food Street' where you can enjoy a round-the-world tour with 'flavor' 365 days a year. When you come out of Exit 1 of Itaewon Station and leave &lt;KFC&gt; to the right, go into the alley, and you can taste Indian cuisine from the front, starting with &lt;Mugle&gt;, where you can taste international cuisine.

There is also a middle-sized relief store, so shopping enthusiasts continue to walk. You can get out of Exit 4 or 3 of Itaewon Station on Subway Line 6. From Exit 3, head towards the direction of Antique Furniture Street and turn left until you reach Ewha Market Street. It is also referred to as the 'African Street' because there are many African restaurants and hair shops.

The symbol of conservativeness, represented by Hijab (Burca, Nicap, and Chador), which covers the face and body of women, is a border between the 'freedom' allowed by 'Itaewon', which is a place where entertainment centers that encompass Islamic culture and sexual minorities are well established.
