   Maze Land is located 22 km from Jeolmul Natural Recreation Forest. Taking advantage of the three characteristics of Samdado, Harbang, the woman, and the wind maze wait for the visitors.

When I looked back because I couldn't find the exit, there were traces of wheelchair wheels on the dirt road in the maze. When you exit the maze, you can see an azimuthal path with orange lights twinkling. Gravel is on the unpaved dirt road and you have to move carefully.
