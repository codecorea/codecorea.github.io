    It is quite exciting to have an arboretum near the place of life. The city's first municipal arboretum appeared in autumn. It is a green arboretum located in Hang-dong, Guro-gu. It is accessible when you take the town bus from the subway station. There is a quiet reed reservoir and you can walk on the Cosmos Pin train track, making it ideal for feeling autumn.

   There are several factors that determine a good arboretum for a family to go to. Once you can find three happy smiles on the children's face, the arboretum is a pretty well-made space. For complex urban people, the arboretum is a place where it can be sunny, wind blowing, learning nature and taking a deep breath. So, it's better if you can go lightly for a while rather than the dense forest hiding in the distance. Even if it is not colorful flowers and autumn leaves, I am happy even if there are only one or two materials to enjoy the changing season. Hangdong Blue Arboretum is a grateful space in that it helps to soothe the tired shoulders of urban people.

   The Blue Arboretum, which represented the first municipal arboretum, debuted this summer. The combined area of the reservoir and the arboretum is 103,000 square meters. Around Arboretum, the contours of Cheonwangsan and the city are in harmony. It is a space located in Seoul, but the greenery comes before the building forest.

   In the former district of Hang-dong, Guro-gu, there were many unlicensed buildings and boardwalks, and the complex was concentrated. The Arboretum, designed as part of the making of green Seoul, contains the sad purpose of preventing the indiscriminate development of the city and creating an eco-friendly ecological space.

   The Blue Arboretum is still an ongoing space. The forest is not dense enough to shade, and plants everywhere are not boasting mature leaves. People who visited the arboretum last summer may have had a hard time. Opening the door this year, it's just a step away, so watching the changing process of the arboretum is quite meaningful.

   The Blue Arboretum has more than 1,700 species of plants and 25 themed gardens including Naeumruru and Sagittarius. Korean herbs are attached to existing herb botanical gardens and aquatic botanical gardens. 'Naraeul' is a place where various deciduous broad-leaved trees are planted, and it is the place where you can get the most of the feeling of the forest in the blue arboretum. 'Namsae Madang', which has 100 foods, is a space where planted edible plants are expressed with the joy of production, fruit, and harvest rather than the splendor of the garden. The ‘Mirnae’, which looks like a dragon moving, has a stream length of 1,000m, and it goes through the thematic gardens and serves as an ecological stream for the arboretum.

    The most eye-catching place in the Blue Arboretum is the space where Hangdong Reservoir and Reed Forest are combined. The reservoir has a wide reed forest. As you walk along the wooden deck between the reeds that are taller than the height, the rose garden “Dalloc Garden” is revealed. Even in the deep autumn, the late red blossoms show off in the daloc garden. The view of the reservoir from the shelter in front of the dalok garden provides a deep fall break. The scenery of ducks under the reed forest is relaxing.

   Another space where you can enjoy autumn together with the reed forest is the Hangdong railway lined up next to the arboretum. Although the abandoned railroad is strictly beyond the arboretum fence, this railroad serves as a filial piety to shine the green arboretum. Cosmos road runs side by side on both sides of the track.
   <br/>
   In fact, this is the place where you can find the biggest laughter on the faces of children. Older adults are reminiscent of memories. Looking down from the railroad tracks, the panoramic view of the arboretum spreads out and the pastel-tone cosmos glistens without hesitation. In an arboretum, you can't get in and out of a railroad track beyond a fence. You can use either the side entrance of the main gate or the small side gate behind the forest ecology hall at the end of the arboretum.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The Blue Arboretum is not a space that is cut off from the surroundings. Like the railroad and cosmos road, the back of the arboretum is connected to the Guro Olle road and leads to a fairly large forest road. The Blue Arboretum is responsible for the axis of the ecological belt that leads to Mount Cheonwang. If walking in the forest is a bit unfortunate in the arboretum, it is good to spend a leisurely time walking through the forest path here.

   The spaces all over represent the nature of the blue arboretum. The Forest Education Center, a bizarre building opposite the Arboretum, is an exhibition hall of useful crops around the world and a place dedicated to plant education, such as “Gardening School”. There is a book cafe at the entrance of the Arboretum, and various cultural programs such as movie screening are being held. The planter stands that recycled concrete walls are also eye-catching.

   There are no restaurants or stalls in the arboretum. However, you can drink hot drinks, such as 2,000 won coffee, in the cafeteria. Simple food can be brought in, but garbage must be taken back. There is a booth where you can rest everywhere, and pet dogs are allowed. The fact that you have to continue walking on the cement road, except for the wooden deck road, is a pity for urban people who are thirsty. On the weekends, parking spaces are also narrow.
