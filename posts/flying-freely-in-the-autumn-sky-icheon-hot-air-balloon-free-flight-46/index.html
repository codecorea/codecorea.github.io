   As a child, I imagined flying freely in a big balloon like a heroine in a fairy tale. The desire to fly in the sky as an adult remains the same. It's exciting to imagine that you're flying in the wind with a hot air balloon instead of an airplane. The place to make that dream come true is Seokyung-ri village in Icheon, Gyeonggi-do.

   A balloon flying in the air with a basket in a large balloon-shaped pocket. There are three major organizations we know. There is a hot air balloon that heats the air with fire and rises to the sky, a gas balloon that fills a balloon with hydrogen or helium, and a rosiere method that is a mixture of a hot air balloon and a gas balloon. It is often the gas balloon that comes only 20-30 meters into the sky after the balloon is tied down at the event or tourist spot.

   The equipment you can experience in Icheon Seogyeong-ri is a hot air balloon that warms air with fire and floats in the sky, allowing you to fly freely in the direction of the wind. It's not just an experience, but a 'flying' flying over the Icheon Plains in a hot air balloon. Rest assured that pilots who are certified by the Korea Organization Association will read and control the wind flow.

   Hot air balloons move along the wind. So they fly between two to three hours after the most stable sun rises. Because of the early morning flight, the Korea Association of Associations operates a one-night and two-day program. In the afternoon of the day before the flight, stay in the village of Seogyeongsul, and prepare to take off after seeing the weather condition around 7 o'clock around dawn.

It's so big that I want to swell it in a circle, but in 15 minutes it's a balloon. When the goofy is filled to some extent, it burns the air with a burner to heat the air. It floats like a balloon in an instant.

When the pilot fires the fire for a long time, the instrument quickly comes to mind. It is more stable than when it comes to land. In a moment, the Seogyeong Reservoir is placed under your feet and the ground crew unwinds the ropes that hold the balloon and the flight begins.

The village under the feet is busy starting the day, and the hot air balloon slowly swims over other worlds. Icheon is surrounded by mountains around Bing, so the wind is stable and it is the only plain in Gyeonggi-do.

   Hot air ballooning flies around two thousand for an hour. Every day, depending on the wind, they fly on an average of 20km to land on the Namhan River, the Anseong River basin, or land on harvested rice fields. Most of them land on rice fields, so free flight is only possible from October to March after the harvest is over. When he flew the farthest, he even went to Chungju. As hot air balloons fly freely, ground agents will follow you from below, so don't worry about going home.
