   Camellia walk and warm winter delicacy, Warangwarang
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Wimi-ri Village in southern Jeju is an essential part of Jeju's winter trip. A fascinating camellia colony that brings out red flowers in midwinter attracts travelers every year. The Camellia colony, as its name suggests, is not a place where camellia trees form a forest, but the trees that grow along the stone walls are so huge that they look like forests from a distance. Camellia is a native variety, so the flowers themselves are not gorgeous. However, the landscape where blossoms fall and form flower paths is not enough to make the winter trip beautiful.

   Just a few steps away from the camellia community, there is a café called Warangwarang, which is known for its atmospheric and delicious coffee. It is a good place to take a leisurely tour of the camellia colony and drink hot coffee to share the afterglow of the trip. The cafe's exterior, neatly decorated, is very comfortable.

   The handwritten menu is full of things to try, including a wide variety of coffees and teas, cookies and juices. Among them, sweet red bean latte and glutinous rice cake are the best delicacies of Warangwarang, which can be enjoyed as a winter dessert. The red bean latte, which is made by boiling domestic red beans, is soft and savory. Fatigue accumulated in pleasant sweetness melts away. If you have a cup of red bean latte with roasted rice cake, you won't have the perfect winter food. Slightly baked rice cakes with plenty of roasted soybean flour make it a little hungry.

   In addition to the café, the company's owners make menus from ingredients they eat, as well as operating a certified organic citrus farm and a custom-made furniture workshop. Thanks to this, the citrus menu from the cafe is also made from high-quality citrus from the farm.

For those who like to eat bread, and to make bread, the Dolgori Café is just a sparrow mill. The taste is delicious, but you can taste the unique bread that is not found in other bakeries.

   Seafood bread made with squid, mackerel, octopus and conch is a popular bread. There's nothing special on the outside, but the seafood is filled with a different force than any other bread. The texture of the soft bread goes well with the chopped seafood. If you eat one or two, the plate will be empty soon. Jeju citrus bread with sweet and sour citrus is topped with a spoonful of mango gelato. Cool and mellow gelato and sour citrus bread make a fantastic harmony in your mouth. In addition to mangoes, there are a variety of gelato so you can choose your own. Doltogo bread made with potato puree also offers a different look.

   Adding a bath will give your feet a pleasant scent and color. You can choose among yuzu, cherry blossom, forest bathing and rose fragrance. Rubbing the beauty salt on the soles of your feet before you finish the foot bath will remove the dead skin cells and make your skin smoother. Wipe dry with a single step and you're done! The fatigue of a midwinter's journey is eased. Foot bath experience is 5,000 won per person.
