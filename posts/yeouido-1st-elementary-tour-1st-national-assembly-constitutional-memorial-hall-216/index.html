    Tours of the National Assembly are divided into the Constitutional Memorial Hall (the National Visitors Center) and the National Assembly. Previously, it was separate, but now it is possible to watch “one stop”. The Constitution Memorial Hall, which displays materials and artifacts related to the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea, can be freely visited, and the National Assembly Building must be gathered as a group at the time of reservation for guidance.
    <br/>
    The dedication memorial hall is composed of the ‘Minister of the National Assembly’, ‘Temporary Assemblyman ’s Hall’, and ‘National Assembly Tour’. At the 'Temporary Court House', you can see the materials related to the provisional court and the first constitutional assembly, which is the legislative institution of the Korean Provisional Government. Space.
    <br/>
    Upon receiving the guidance of the National Assembly guide, the House of Parliament listens to explanations of what the National Assembly is doing, and actually visits the main venue where the bill is being processed. The advantage is that all explanations are made to fit the eye level of the children. Rather than letting parents know something more by studying separately, it's a good idea to research the National Assembly with your child in advance and summarize your child's questions and ask the guide.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Then, let's go on a full-fledged tour of the National Assembly from now on. First, when you enter the entrance of the National Assembly, two Haitai greets visitors. Originally, Haitai is a legendary animal that judges fertility and good and evil. Because of this symbolism, it was a symbol of Saheungbu, an organization that inspects officials in the Joseon Dynasty. Perhaps the National Assembly stood in front of the National Assembly in the sense that the National Assembly would act on behalf of the people to monitor the government and correct the errors. Let's tell the children that this is the meaning of the name of the cookie maker.

   Facing Haetaesang and walking to the right for about 5 minutes, today's first destination, the dedication memorial, appears. You can enter by entering the National Assembly Visitor Center on the right side of the entrance and confirming the reservation. When you open the three glass doors, you can see the portraits of the former National Assembly Speakers to the right of the large hall. The main hall is always in a 'special exhibition', but it is good to start watching by watching a promotional video about the functions and roles of the National Assembly right in the public relations video theater on the right. Robot Taekwon V comes out and kindly explains it to the eye level of children. If your father tells you that rumors of a robot Taekwon V secret base in the Capitol were spinning when he was a child, how would the children react?

   The children's experience room, decorated with colorful primary colors, is a place where children can have fun. You can experience the functions of the Korean National Assembly and the principles of democracy while touching, turning, watching and enjoying. There is also a corner in the subsequent National Assembly of the Republic of Korea that informs the operation principle and composition of the Korean National Assembly and at the same time looks around the world's parliament. It would be interesting to compare our parliament with other parliaments. Looking at the Constitution Hall, the last exhibition room of the Memorial Hall, the supplementary explanation of the father is necessary. It explains what the Constituent Assembly is, and why it was necessary to convene from the Constitutional Assembly to establish a country after liberation.

   It takes about an hour to tour all of the Memorial Halls. Then, in front of the Memorial Hall, take a shuttle bus to the National Assembly to head to the National Assembly Building. Unfortunately, the red carpeted staircase, which appears in the news every day, is an exclusive entrance to the National Assembly. Visitors must enter the parliament building by the back aisle. From here, the guide of the National Assembly staff begins.

   The first stop is the National Assembly Hall. It is a space under the dome that looks like a symbol of the National Assembly Building. The marble on the floor and the lighting on the ceiling dome create an exotic atmosphere. After walking around the main hall for a while, we move to the 4th floor exhibition hall to hear brief explanations and see various activities of the National Assembly. This is a review of what I have already seen from the Constitutional Memorial Hall. The dedication memorial hall summarized the contents that were divided into various exhibition halls into a panorama on one wall. After looking around the exhibition hall, we will finally head to the highlight of today, the main assembly hall.

It is a phenomenon that many people use wide-angle lenses when trying to show the entire conference hall.

   The most important thing that 299 members of Congress do in the National Assembly is legislative action that makes the law. People's lives are determined by what laws the National Assembly makes, so it is a very powerful authority. Next, the enactment activities to deliberate and inspect the country's livelihood. It is about deliberating and deciding on a country's budget for the year. In addition, the National Assembly is responsible for checking the administration. All these things are called ‘politics’. So politics is so important and essential that we can ignore it as dirty. This is why children should look around at the National Assembly and pay attention to politics.

    Constitutional Memorial Hall and the National Assembly Building are not the only highlights of the National Assembly. Along with the National Library of Korea, the National Library of Korea, the representative library in Korea, is also a place to go with children. In order to go with your child, you can visit the Internet three days before the desired date of visit.

    ) Must be applied in advance. If the weather is good, it is good to take a walk in the National Assembly. You can take a rest for a while after climbing the Uiwon Garden, where the wonderful hanok is located. If it is unfortunate to come to Yeouido and see only the National Assembly, the tour hall of the nearby broadcasting station is also a place that children will like. No reservation is required unless you are in a group.
