   The way people feel the change of the season is different. Scanning my body in the morning and evening, the cool breeze passing by, the warm afternoon sun, and the coffee scent of the classic cafe that feels strong today make the season change.

   Heroine in autumn, Cosmos
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The main character of Hadong in autumn is definitely Cosmos. Cosmos is full of large land around Bukcheon Station and Bukcheon Elementary School. The three buckwheat flowers, which have been carefully bloomed, are no less than the cosmos, but the soothing buckwheat flowers gave way to Cosmos for the heroine of autumn in Bukcheon-myeon. Bukcheon-myeon Cosmos Complex was built around the newly built Bukcheon Station. From Bukcheon-myeon Office and the old Bukcheon Station (Hadong Rail Park), go 1km in the direction of Hadong, and you will see the newly built Bukcheon Station. After passing Bukcheon Station, a wide cosmos complex spreads from side to side.

   The first visitor to the cosmos complex is the tunnel of good luck. Gourds, scrubbers, snake-like cucumbers and pumpkin vines made a cozy arch tunnel. It is blessed to see the coveted parks that seem to fall on the ground even at a moment's notice. It is literally awesome.

   After passing through the tunnel of good luck, baekilhong (aka baekilhong) bloomed around a small pond. It feels completely different from the flowers of the pear tree, which is common in late summer and early autumn. The flowers of the pear tree are sometimes called zinnia, but the species are different. Baek Il-hong is an annual plant of the Chrysanthemum family, with large clusters and various colors. The size and density of the blossoms are so different that it does not shake heavily even in the autumn breeze. You are heavier than Cosmos. The baekilhong colony located on one side of the cosmos flower field is small in size, but it plays a role as a photo point of the Bukcheon Cosmos Complex.

   After passing the tall bridge next to Baek Il-hong, the orange flower swayed in the autumn breeze and shouted at him. It is a yellow flower cosmos. The flower has a dark orange color and is called 'yellow flower' cosmos. The orange flowers are crowded together, so they hold the camera. At the moment, it is difficult to know which angle and where to focus. However, regardless of the angle or focus, the result is not bad because the flower is filled with the flower in the frame.

   Shy buckwheat flowers settled in the corner of the cosmos complex. It seems that the white flowers that filled the large fields were sprayed with white salt as described in the short story, “When the Buckwheat Flowers Fill”. Hyo-Seok Lee described the appearance as "the hillside is a buckwheat field all over, and the flowers that began to bloom are sprinkled with salty moonlight." The more you read, the more beautiful it is. A sperm standing in the distance makes the buckwheat field more rich. It seems that the old stiletto bobssangers also walked in the buckwheat flower field all night and rested in that pavilion.

   From the buckwheat flower field to the entrance, around Bukcheon Elementary School, and across the road with red windmills, there is a cosmos all over the hill. If the queen of autumn chrysanthemum is 'my sister's flower' that came back from the back of youth, the fragile cosmos swayed by the wind is 'my sister's flower'. People are busy taking memories of the cosmos and the autumn breeze, leaving flowers everywhere.

   Alone or two or three, five or three, come in a bunch and put their memories on the autumn when they stop at Bukcheon Station for a while. The Hadong Bukcheon Cosmos and Buckwheat Flower Festival is held from September 20 to October 6. Two or three days after the festival is over, the Cosmos is replaced for the 'Poppy Festival' next spring, so it is not too long to enjoy Cosmos in Bukcheon.

   Now it's time to enjoy Bukcheon Cosmos more uniquely. Go to Hadong Rail Park where you can take a cool rail bike along the Cosmos Railway. Hadong Rail Park is located in the old Bukcheon Station opposite the Bukcheon-myeon Office. In July 2016, Bukcheon Station moved to its present location, and the old Bukcheon Station was refurbished as a rail bike facility. The concept of Hadong Rail Park is Cosmos. You can walk down the cool road while looking at the cosmos in full bloom throughout the 5.3km section.

   Another competitive advantage of Hadong Rail Park is that you can enjoy the rail bike effortlessly. The rail bike section of Bukcheon Station has a slight incline, so when you go to Yangbo Station (closed station), where you depart, take the Mika Sightseeing Train or get help from a tow truck. Then, when you arrive at the starting point, you can follow the low downhill and brake elegantly. Unlike other rail bikes in other areas where sweating and legs are tingling, you need to worry about speed.

   Hadong Rail Park is operated by reservation system. If you want to ride a rail bike, you can make a reservation in advance on the homepage or use an unscheduled internet on the spot. During the festival, there are many people, so it is recommended to make a reservation in advance. In history, there is a train cafe that remodels the train. If you're waiting for rail bike time or you can't ride a rail bike, it's okay to have a cup of tea in a train cafe.

   The trip to Bukcheon Cosmos ends with the sound of grass and a cup of fragrant coffee. Mokyawon, opposite Bukcheon Station, is served by the owner's coffee beans. I want to enter a two-story house with a large lawn garden and terrace. Warm Americano costs 4,000 won and the price is good. Mokyawon, where you can see Bukcheon Station from anywhere in the cafe, is a real resting place for true travellers. According to the owner, "In the cosmos season, there are many customers who come by train on KORAIL or drive to Jinju Station or Suncheon Station to come to Bukcheon Station by train, visit Cosmos, drink a cup of coffee, and go." It is a true resting place for true travel enthusiasts who weave autumn, cosmos and a cup of coffee into one 'train'. During the Hadong Bukcheon Cosmos and Buckwheat Flower Festival, traffic jams are severe and parking is not easy, so it would be a wise way to travel to Bukcheon by using the train to tour the Bukcheon Cosmos Festival and returning home without any time loss at Bukcheon Station.
