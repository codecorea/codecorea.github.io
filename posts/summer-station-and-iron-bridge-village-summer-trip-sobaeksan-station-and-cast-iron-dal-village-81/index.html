   Village with cast iron legs

  <div class="txt_p">
   Iron Dal Village has long been unknown. Only the people of Punggi avoided the rushing valley of the crowds. It is known that the village of Iron Dal was made after the restoration of Jukyeong Old Road and the passing of Sobaeksan Mountain. Jukyeong Ancient Road was the first road cultural property in Korea and was designated as the 30th scenic spot in 2007. In Samguk Sagi, it is said that “Jukryeong Road was opened only in the fifth year of King Silla Adala (158 AD)”, which is close to 1,900 years.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Sobaeksan Station was a landmark of the cast iron village. It opened as a simple station in April 1942 and was promoted to a normal station in 1951 during the Korean War. For a while most of the trains stopped at Sobaeksan Station. It is the closest train station to Sobaeksan Mountain. Those who visited Sobaeksan Station at that time are more familiar with the old name of Heebangsa Temple. Just five to six years ago it was not so called.

   The rare warrior is a temple in the rare valley, and has a special relationship with the Iron Dal Village. Iron moon means iron bridge. The former name of Suchul-ri was Sucheol-ri. Anecdotes related to names go back to the Three Kingdoms period. In 12 years King Silla Deok Deung, Hee-unsaung Doo-un saved a tiger with a hairpin on her neck. The tiger took the daughter of Sorabul captain Yoo Suk to pay the favor. Doun-nim was very angry and sent Yoo Suk's daughter back to Seorabul. Ho Jang Yoo is a legend that he put an iron bridge on the stream of nobleman as a token of gratitude. So how can you erase that name easily? Even now, the station called Hee-Raesa is written next to the sign at Sobaeksan Station. When booking tickets for trains, they use the name Hee-sa Station. In May, he filmed the movie Sobaeksan Station. It is the story of a station worker and villagers who want to save a small station. Iron Dal Village is a film story and live set in itself.
