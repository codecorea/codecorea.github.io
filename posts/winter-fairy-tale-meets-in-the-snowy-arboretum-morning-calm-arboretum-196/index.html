    When it was snowy winter, I visited the morning calm arboretum, a winter kingdom that glistens with a brilliant autumnal glow. Many people visit the arboretum even in this season thanks to the “Five Starlight Garden” held every winter. When the darkness fell, I followed the colored lights blooming. It is also suitable for a quiet downtown dating course. A winter festival of lights held at this time of year. The five-pointed starlight garden, which celebrated its eighth anniversary this year, will continue until March 15, when the vegetation is asleep.

    I visited a quiet morning serene arboretum before lighting the five-colored starlight garden. Morning Calm Arboretum, which settled at the foot of Gapyeongsan Mountain in Gapyeong, Gyeonggi-do, has been loved by the public since it was selected as a filming location for various movies and dramas. The arboretum itself is also an attractive destination, thanks to various attractions of Gapyeong such as Churyeongsan, Petite France, and Nami Island.

    Thanks to this, the five-colored Starlight Garden in winter is followed by the Wildflower Exhibition and Spring Flower Festival in spring, the Cornus and Mugunghwa Festival in summer, and the Chrysanthemum Festival and the Autumn Leaves Festival in autumn. The four seasons of the Arboretum are a series of transformation. However, the admission fee is quite challenging. Prices based on weekends: 9,000 won for regular students, 6500 won for middle and high school students, and 5500 won for children. On the weekends during the Five Star Garden, there are a lot of visitors. If you want to enjoy the festival more leisurely, consider finding it on weekdays. You can go around the arboretum in about an hour, so if you come by 8 o'clock, there is no big crowd to enjoy the festival.

   To do this, it is a good idea to take a look at the brochure located at the arboretum ticket office. I decided to take a round tour of the Morning Calm Arboretum before dark. After passing the ticket office, the first hometown garden welcomes you. This is the first time to announce that you have come to the Morning Calm Arboretum. When the day comes, you pass through the light tunnel to light up and walk into the winter fairy tale. After that, a pair of cygnus facing the large maple tree touches the waiting bonsai garden. It is a place that is loved as a point of photography for lovers.

   In the bright sun, the calm morning morning arboretum, as its name suggests, wakes up as darkness comes. If you look at the arboretum when there is still sunlight than it is after dark, you can see a clearer difference. On Saturdays, until 11 PM, everything else lights up until 9 PM. The time when the light comes on differs little by little around the sunset. Still, the light comes on before the day is completely over. It's fun to take pictures while watching the difference in light between bright and dark.
