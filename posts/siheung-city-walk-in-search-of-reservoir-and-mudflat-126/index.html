   Former President Syngman Rhee Enjoys Fishing at Water King Reservoir
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The waterside outing course in Siheung City consists of Mulwang Reservoir → Lotus Theme Park → Siheung Tidal Valley Ecological Park → Wolgotpo-gu.
   <br/>
   The first place to look for is Water Reservoir. The 3rd Gyeongin Expressway, the Seoul Outer Ring Road, and the West Coast Expressway pass nearby, so it is not difficult to visit. Although Heungbu Reservoir is the official name, Water King Reservoir is still more familiar. When the reservoir was installed, it was named 'Hungbu Reservoir' after each letter because it is on the border between Siheung and Bucheon, but it is more widely known as 'Water King Reservoir' because it is located in Mulwang-dong for local residents or travelers. In the late 1950s, former President Syngman Rhee made frequent visits with his own fishing spot.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Even today, many people like to walk, ride bikes, or go fishing. After sunset, many people try to get the romance of cafes. There is a road that circulates through the reservoir, and there is a long driveway to the north. Cars can cause dirt, so try to go as slowly as possible. You can walk round the banks of the west.

  <div class="txt_p">
   For autumn trips, it is more appropriate to carry a collection of poetry or essays on a backpack rather than a snack. Settled in a quiet café and sipping a glass of Americano, a few strands of fallen leaves floated up and down the lawn along the wind from the reservoir. Gently pull out a essays. Reading a passage from the essay “Burning leaves,” written by novelist Lee Hyo-seok, seems to return to the days of emotional schooling.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   “Is there something like the smell of burning leaves? It smells like freshly roasted coffee. It smells like ripe hazelnuts. If you hold a rake in your hand and stand tall in the smoke forever, looking at the mountains of litter and scattered leaves and smelling fragrant, you'll feel motivated by a fierce life. The smoke will end up in the body, and at any point, it will smell from the hem and back of the hand. ”

  <div class="txt_p">
   I put the autumn sky in the calm reservoir in my heart and visit the lotus theme park for a while before going to the gutters. The lotus leaves that bloomed lushly last summer changed their clothes to yellow in the fall, and the black lotus was exposed over the blue sky. Only a few drills show me on the surface and say, 'I haven't spent a hot summer yet.'

   Siheung Tidal Flat Ecological Park with 3 Tours
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Today's third visit is Siheung Tidal Flat Ecological Park. It is an environmentally friendly travel destination where you can learn about the process of making natural salt, study reeds and other salt plants, and get along with the salty autumn breeze. In particular, people who have the question, 'Jeonna Salt, Jeollanam-do or Yeong-gun, aren't you?' At high tide, seawater flows from the West Sea to the bottom of Sorae Bridge into the inner city of Incheon and Siheung. For this reason, torsion has developed in these areas since ancient times, and traces remain. Siheung City Ecological Park is established in Siheung City, and Sorae Wetland Ecological Park is established in Incheon City.

All three courses are designed to intersect through the Rock Observation Deck in the middle. However, regardless of the course, you can go freely as you like. Most of the way out like a labyrinth is flat, so it is not uncomfortable to walk.

   When you enter the promenade, you lie down every time the wind blows and then stand up again to hear the legend of autumn in the reeds. The reeds here are young, and the colors are softer than those in places like Ansan Reed Marsh Park. Among the poems written by the poet Nervim about reeds are these verses: "He didn't know that living was crying silently in this way." I did. Living day by day is a sublime act that endures with a firm root even if it is hard to fall down and strong winds blow. Wouldn't it have been a meaningless day if you didn't have a reed field outing on the lagoons?
