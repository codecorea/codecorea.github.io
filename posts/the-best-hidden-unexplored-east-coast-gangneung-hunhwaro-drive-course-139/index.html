   Along the winding coastal roads, the landscape changes. Calm white sand stretches out calmly, while magnificent rock formations appear rough. Some of them move on the surfboards and move wildly, while others lay down a fishing rod and remain silent. Gangneung Hunhwa-ro is a place where you can run along the indigo sea and face the harsh and mild scenery.

   With a wreath of the legend of Mrs.
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Hunhwaro runs from Gangneung Geumjin Beach to Jeongdongjin Port. Hunhwa-ro has Jeongdongjin to the north and Okgye Beach to the south. In 1998, the Jinjin-Shimgok Port section was opened for the first time, and the 2001 Shingok Port-Jeongdongjin Port section was extended. In Geumjin, the Simgok section is a coastal road, and in Simgok port, the Jeongdongjin section is an inland road. The coastal road to Hwahwa-ro filled the sea. It is known as the closest road to the sea in Korea. In fact, when you run down this road, you feel like you are running on the sea.

   But why is the name of the road as a wreath? It is reminiscent of &lt;Hunhwasa&gt; in The Three Kingdoms History. Mrs. Su-ro, wife of Sun Jeonggong in Gangneung Taesu in the Silla era, was famous for being a savvy woman. Mrs. Su-ro went to Gangneung for a while and rested at the beach. At that time, I saw a beautiful rhododendron bloom on the cliff and asked if there was a tooth to pick, but all said it was impossible. However, an old man who passed by said that he picked up flowers and gave them to Mrs. The background of the story fits nicely with the scenery of the place, so it was named “Hunhwaro”.

   The narrative is the background, making the Hunhwaro a deeper and more mysterious space. But it is not only the narrative that makes the wreath special. The stunning view that blends with the coastal road is also a big attraction. It's as vivid as the waves that touch the rocks. In fact, waves are so close to the sea that sea water is pushed down the road. Nowadays, the visibility is better than in 1998, when it was first established. After the road was damaged by the waves, it was renovated in 2008. Previously, the roadside balustrade had a height of 1.2m, which obscured the view. The strange rock formations and the superb view of the sea rush into the snow.

   Relaxing Jinjin Beach with vintage cafes and surfers

  <div class="txt_p">
   With the offering, the drive can be started from Jeongdongjin or Jinjin. You can enjoy the superb view in any direction, but if you're in the first place, start with Jinjin. You can feel the climax of the scenery that starts calmly and reaches the peak. Entering the Hunhwa-ro from Okgye IC and running towards the sea, there is a point that is gently turned to the left. This is where the cool scenery of the wreath begins. When the sea hides and hides and turns around the corner, it appears like a “gift of surprise”. Many people stop in the calm seascape. There is ample parking and a seating area to relax.

   If you enjoyed the sea while enjoying the yogi, now is a good time to enjoy the beach. Quiet and secluded Geumjin Beach unfolds before your eyes. The news that tens of thousands of people gathered at Gyeongpo Beach and Haeundae during the summer season seems like a distant world. Geumjin Beach is secluded even in midsummer. There are many regular summer vacationers who are attracted to such attraction.

   Enjoy a leisurely rest at Geumjin Beach, then head back to Hunhwa-ro. You can ride a car or bike, or just walk. From Jinjin Port to Simgok Port, it can be said to be the beauty of Hunhwa-ro. The meandering views spread along the winding coast. The scenery created by the rock formations and the indigo sea creates a moist feeling for even the most blunt.

   In the middle of the road, you stop and look at the sea. It is a wasteful scene to pass by car. You can also park your car at Simgok Port or Geumjin Port. The distance from Jinjin Port to Simgok Port is about 2km. I recommend walking slowly, if not all sections.

   The path from Geumjin Port to Simgok Port is on one side of the sea and on the other is a strange rock formation. It's hard to find a shop. You can use the shops in Jinjin Port or Simgok Port. Near Jinjin Port, a stall called `` Hang-gu wagon '' is famous. Some people deliberately come to Jinjin Port in search of port wagons. It is famous for its kalguksu and crab sashimi. It's a tacky small stall but there are always many customers. These simple things, combined with the magnificent natural scenery, make the wreath stand out even more.
