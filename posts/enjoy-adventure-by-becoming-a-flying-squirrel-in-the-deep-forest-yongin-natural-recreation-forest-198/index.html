   The Yongin Natural Recreation Forest, Eco-D Venture, tends to be full on the weekends, but it's easy to make a reservation during the week. However, it may be convenient to make a reservation in advance, as it may not be available for group reservations.

    Make a reservation with the 10 o'clock experience and go to Eco-D Venture. The morning forest road is absolutely refreshing. It is available six times a day, at 10 am, 11 am, 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm, and 5 pm. Each seat has 20 people except 5 pm. Even in the woods, it's hot in the middle of the day, so it's a good idea to make a reservation in the morning or late.

   When you arrive at Ecored Venture, check your reservation first, and then wear hard hat, gloves, and safety equipment. Children's gloves are also available, so don't worry. After all safety equipment is worn, safety training is conducted prior to the actual operation. At this time, it tells you how to use the equipment and cautions. When grabbing the pulley used to go on a rope, one hand should hold the pulley and the other hand should hold the string. When the pulley rolls, never bring your hand in front of it, as there is a risk of injury.

   After completing the training, move to the small practice space located next to you to practice hooking and pulling out the hook and putting on and off the pulley. When a child is young, the grip strength is weak, so it is not easy to use equipment, but if you practice a few times and learn the tips, you can do it yourself.

   Courses are divided into monkey, chimpanzee, and king kong courses. The Monkey Course can be challenged for toddlers 5-6 years old, the Chimpanzee Course is for children 7-10 years old, and the King Kong Course is for adults 11 years old and older. The King Kong course is made of taller and more distant trees than the monkey and chimpanzee courses, so it feels quite thrilling. The Monkey Course and Chimpanzee Course do not differ significantly in difficulty, so even toddlers can try the Chimpanzee Course. You can do two courses together or just one, but if you are a king, it is good to try both courses. It is too short for one course, and the children are disappointed because the equipment usage is over.

   When I receive safety education, every time a child who is overwhelmed nervously challenges one by one, he gains confidence, feels fun, and brightens his face. It is especially exciting when flying through a tree in a pulley. I feel like I'm Tarzan flying freely through the jungle. After all the courses are over, the children shout “One more time!” With the above-mentioned expression. It takes about an hour to complete safety training and finish the monkey course and chimpanzee course. The duration of the King Kong course is similar. There is no age limit, but you need to be over 110cm tall to challenge.

  <div class="txt_p">
   Many people use Yongin Natural Recreation Forest, but campsites are also popular. Even in the middle of winter, it is difficult to grab a site on the weekend. You can get a feeling of being surrounded by nature by constructing a site naturally by cascading between dense trees and on a mountain slope. It's cumbersome to have your car parked in the parking lot and move your hand luggage, but thanks to it, you can see it separately at night and hear the bugs and camp as naturally as possible.

   There are several playgrounds at the entrance to the campsite, all of which are forest playgrounds for children. There are no rides common in apartment complexes. Here, the playground is also “green”. Riding a horse, climbing on a slide of a wooden house, and holding a line on a wooden barrel connected between wooden pillars and crossing it. Even if you play all day, the kids don't seem bored.

   Ecod Venture is located in the innermost part of the recreational forest. On the way, you will naturally pass through the wetlands. The deck is spread over the wetland area, so it is easy to walk lightly. There are also several stairs, but you can also look around with a stroller, mainly made of ramps. The sound of a frog rumbling around a small pond where you can observe lotus flowers, aquatic plants, and insects, and flowers bloom from time to time by collecting wild flowers and native flowers around us. As you climb up the promenade, there are also salamander habitats, as well as signs of “snake vigilance”. Be careful as snakes can actually pass over promenades.

   The lawn plaza, which is the front yard of the recreational forest, is a place where visitors on the weekend install a mat, tent, and tarp. From last spring, as the weekend visitors were switched to the reservation system, the dense grassy squares were freed up and parking and vehicle congestion problems were eliminated. If you want to enjoy outings on the weekends on the day of the Ecod Ventures and Recreation Forest, you must make a reservation. There is no need to make a separate admission reservation when using the accommodation.

   Yongin Natural Recreation Forest is also a paragliding mecca. Several paragliding specialists are located at the entrance of the recreational forest, and there is an active factory at the top of Jeonggwangsan (563m) that rises behind the recreational forest. On a weekday, a paraglider that seemed rare, flies at once as if it bloomed in the sky on the weekend. The arrival point is just below the recreational forest, so it's interesting to see it landing by turning on the lawn square. There are also two-person experience flights accompanied by experts, so if you are curious, take the courage to challenge.
