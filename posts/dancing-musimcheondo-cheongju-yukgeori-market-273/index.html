    Travelers who know the charm of traditional markets take a tour of the local traditional market as an essential course. This is because it is fun to walk around and watch around with the freedom of the stranger and to visit restaurants that have kept a place for a long time. Chungcheongbuk-do Cheongju Land Market is a market with many things to see and eat to be included in the top 10 tours of Cheongju. There is a Mushimcheondo six-way street market that runs through the city of Cheongju, so it seems like you are dancing.

    It is not a three-way intersection. Cheongju Yukgeori Market is located in front of the intersection of 6 branches. Three of the six roads lead to the market, which is said to have been formed naturally in the late Joseon Dynasty, so the market was born before the road. The Wu Market, which was formed on the Musimcheon River, the forge for making farm equipment, and the rice bowl became the starting point of the six-way street market.
    <br/>
    I am worried that traditional markets all over the country are losing their vitality by losing their commercial spaces to large marts, except for the sixth street market. There are more than 1,200 stores and stalls gathering, and the market is enjoying an average of 50,000 to 60,000 people a day. In 2009, he was selected as the nation's best market and received the Presidential Citation. What is the reason? Let's start exploring the sixth street market. You may get lost for a while while walking through a crowded market. It is a market where new sights take hold even when hovering in the same place.

    There are stalls selling fresh vegetables and fish in the central aisle of the six-way street market, and on both sides, you can see a side-by-side mill with a fragrant smell and delicious side dishes. Even if the stores seem to be mixed up, each passage has its own unique names such as mill street, food street, wild vegetable street, and fashion street.
    <br/>
    If you follow the direction on the right side of the street, there are lined houses and rice cakes along a narrow alley. The sizzling sound calls out to the guests, and the people attracted by the savory scent gather as they taste. It is 3,000 won in one pack of well-baked transitions. The amount is plentiful compared to the price.

It is a scene that is as exciting as if you are watching the holiday market. This alley lined with whole houses and rice cake houses is also home to shops famous for their baekbaek and Ibaji cuisine.

    To the right of the rice cake alley, there are two restaurants representing the six-way street market.
    <br/>
    Saega Deoksoondae (043-254-2739) is the first restaurant in Igu-dong Province. As it is a restaurant with 34 years of history, the taste of Sundae Gukbap is excellent. White meat is boiling in a large pot hanging in front of the store. When a customer orders, a bowl of rice is served with sundae and pressed pork, and several times, it is prepared and served. Soondae is filled with soup and sesame seeds that have no taste at all. If several people come together, Sundae hotpot and Sundae stir-fried are also recommended.

    Sunjanejukjip (043-257-4226), where you can feel the warmth from the name, is a restaurant with lots of food to enjoy even if you are not hungry. In addition to the signboard menus, pumpkin porridge, red bean porridge, sesame porridge, and soybean porridge, it is fun to pick and eat buckwheat pancakes, buckwheat pancakes, and kimchi pancakes that are served directly in front of the store by Kalguksu. The price is also cheap. Opened 15 years ago, this restaurant has many regular customers who have to wait for an empty seat during lunch.
    <br/>

   The boat was first filled for a long tour, but other foods caught my eye. The red bean bread, which is apparently just taken out of the oven, is smiling as it shakes the temptation of homemade dumplings stuffed with smoked meat and turns around. Baro-bakun Bakery (043-221-5657) is displaying the bread that has just been baked. The savory bread smell makes you feel better.

   Stepping into the market, elephant dumplings (043-221-0552) and gyeyeongsaengwa (010-4502-2824) face each other with fruit stalls spreading sweet scents. After a happy worry between freshly steamed dumplings, large steamed buns and crispy pastries, he holds a basket of fresh seasonal fruit in his hand. The price is good, not to mention freshness.
   <br/>
   When you come to the Yukgeori Market, you can buy and sell pastries at the factory in Gyeongju. It is more popular because it is made by the owner himself. There are a lot of pastries in the shape of the first look, and you can get fun to watch.

    Buying a bag of pastry and eating it is a fashion street. From cool dresses to shirts and inexpensive pants, she calls her aunts. Women's clothing with colorful flowers stand out just by looking at them and smiling. The names of the shops such as “Gagopa Clothing” and “Namdaemun Shopping” are also pretty.
    <br/>
    On the opposite side of the fashion street, there are miscellaneous goods street and coma futon street. Dawn Market, Wholesale Market, and Farm Equipment Street are together, so you can see that the pride of Cheongju is the biggest. It is also a big advantage that the family can use it for shopping because they can use a large cart that can only be found in a large mart. The cart is located in the parking lot inside the market.
    <br/>
    You may get lost for a moment in a market like a checkerboard. But don't worry. You can meet Seongan-gil, which runs from the fashion street, or Musimcheon, which flows like a market. As you get lost, you can go on an outing to Seongan-gil, which can be called Myeongdong in Cheongju.
