   By the time all of these memories were immersed, various villagers left for Chuncheon or farther. Residents who couldn't leave their hometowns moved to new houses on high hills, avoiding rising water. So, several island villages were formed along the stream of Soyang Lake. Booguri and Ohangri were also one of the island villages. The island village on the land was the only link to the outside, with boats going twice a day.

   I wanted to go along a winding path along Buguiro, but soon it turned into a steep slope and the altitude increased. As you climb near the ridge of the Hau Pass, you can see the shape of the powerful mountain line of Obongsan and Buyongsan on the left at a glance. Soyang Lake is shined by sunlight.

There is a signboard called 'Geonbongryeong Seunghodae' at the place where the mountain valley is left 2.5km. Soyangho from here is truly superb. The moment you turn around the hill, the exclamation point bursts into a fantastic view that is difficult to say. Is it the sea in the land? Or would it be called Dowonkyung in the mountains? The lakeside shines blue with the light of the sky, and small islands are floating in various places, and it seems to have met a calm sea. No, it is better than any other sea.
