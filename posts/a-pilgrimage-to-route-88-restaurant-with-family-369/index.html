    Starting from the southern end of the Paldang Bridge, the 45th National Road Drive Road, winding along the riverside to the left, is dazzling with fresh green. Light sunshine knocks on the car like a piano playing from the audio. When the riverside road ends, take the road on the left side of the Toma 3-way intersection, and National Highway 88 begins. It is a road leading to Toechon-myeon. The landscape of the river that has been resumed is the Gyeongan Lake, which is connected to the Paldang Lake. Crossing the bridge and entering the Toechon-myeon area, there is the first restaurant on Route 88.

    Route 88 leads to the left from the intersection leading to the Tianjin Am Holy Land. This is the starting point of the ridge of Yangpyeong, where the small shopkeepers went to go to Gwangju's small market. This place, where the cows who had struggled over their heads were fed grass and the small intestines were resting their sore legs, was called 'Sommoegi'.
    <br/>
    Born and raised in Toechon, Mr. Jeong Ji-soo produced a Korean restaurant that served as a side dish of Cheonggukjang and herbs cooked directly on the soil of Sommegigol inherited from his father. The name is ‘Sommegigi’ (031-767-9852).

    “In spring, I have no mind to care for the herbs I bought from all over the country. In winter, my wrists are swollen and my wrists are swollen.”

   <p>
    This is a story from the owner who shows the herbs hanging from the main curtain next to the main restaurant. When I untie the string of the siraegi, the smell of the old time bursts out.

   Even the person who listens to the pride of the owner is full. Let's go into the restaurant to taste the pride of the owner. Thick wooden tables and chairs are placed inside the ocher wall, which the owner's son personally decorated. I can feel the hospitality of a guest with a single flower of a grandmother placed on a plate. It would mean not just eating a bowl of rice and standing up, but also to enjoy the atmosphere and fashion of this house.

    When I ordered Cheongguk Jang Hwang Tae-Gi, a cup of Dong Dong-Ju made of millet and pine needles, a salad of radish, and a salad came out. The soup is filled with the newly cooked stone cooked rice, plus the savory Cheonggukjang. In order to feel the unique scent, it is busy to put the chopsticks on the side dish without seasoning and the light pickles without salty taste. Above all, Cheonggukjang, where the beans are chewy, has a strong smell and is not salty.

   When you cross the Sommegi Pass, Route 88 continues toward Yangpyeong. Beyond the ridge, there is a restaurant called “Lato Marte” (031-767-0558), which air-fires Italian ash and bakes pizza in a homemade oven. This restaurant is said to say, "If you taste the pizza in this house, you will never eat the pizza in the franchise restaurant."

   Kwon Soon-jo and Sung-suk Kwon, who worked at a multinational corporation's Washington branch, enjoyed visiting an Italian restaurant near Washington. After returning home, Kwon Soon-jo replaced lunch with a sandwich lunch box that his wife made, and he said that the sandwich lunch box was popular with colleagues.

    A man who was an executive of a multinational company with a high salary, untie his tie one day and decide to retire early. This is why I was not happy. The wife was happy to agree.
    <br/>
    “I had no idea at first. I traveled to the mountains to meet. I really hated shaving and haircuts while I was at work, but I also liked my beard and hair. I even raised my hair to the waist. ”
    <br/>
    The couple, who traveled and arranged a house in Toechon, opened a pizza restaurant with the intention of sharing with neighbors. The good-looking wife was in charge of spaghetti. This created a restaurant run by two people without a single employee. It was 10 years ago.

   “I never went to learn how to make pizza or anything like that. I love pizza and bread, so when I retire later, I have to do bakery, and I had such vague hope. ”
   <br/>
   The success of his son in the United States has identified Italy's best food supply route. After several experiments and failures depending on his taste, the right pizza began to be baked.
   <br/>
   At the same time as the order, my husband, Mr. Kwon Soon-jo, is in charge of the entire process of burning wood fires in the oven and preparing toppings and baking in the meantime. Bake the savory bread yourself. Mr. Yoo Sung-suk is in charge of salad, spaghetti, dessert, and serving.
