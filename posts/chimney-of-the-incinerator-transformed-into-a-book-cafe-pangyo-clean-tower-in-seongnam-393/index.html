    What if the waste incinerator is around the house? It is almost certain that residents will walk and oppose retail protests and signatures. The garbage incinerator located in Pangyo, Seongnam is slightly different. The Pangyo Environmental Energy Facility equipped with a sports center for residents, and the Pangyo Water Quality Restoration Center, which is difficult to find out whether it is a sewage treatment plant by underground, are no longer evasion facilities. The Pangyo Clean Tower, where the chimney of the garbage incinerator was reborn as an observatory and book cafe, is rather proud.

   Pangyo Clean Tower, located in front of Pangyo Techno Valley. It is called a garbage incinerator, but it has no smell. The small sports center and observatory have a clean first impression, and the wide open park is full of autumn.

   Take the elevator to the book cafe, which is 48m high. With an elevator in between, one is a book cafe and the other is a chat room. A small library is better than a book cafe. They do not sell coffee, etc., and food is not allowed for comfortable reading. Centered on the bookshelf, there are 4 round tables and 2 square tables with multi-tabs. It is a small size with only 41 seats.

    The best pride of the book cafe is the prospect. You can see from all sides and there are not many high-rise buildings nearby, so you can see far. The Gyeongbu Expressway and Pangyo IC can be seen right next to it, and the Hwarang Park opens underneath. Pangyo Techno Valley is the shape surrounding the park, and Pangyo Station and the construction site are visible to the southeast. The west side of the highway and the east side of Pangyo Station are apartment forests.

   The forest of Hwarang Park is colored in autumn. While constructing the Pangyo new city, they gathered existing trees and created a forest here. In addition, an ecological lake was created at the junction of Unjungcheon and Geumtocheon so that animals and plants living in wetlands can be observed.
