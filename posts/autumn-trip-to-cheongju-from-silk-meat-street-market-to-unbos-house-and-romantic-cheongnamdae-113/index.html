  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The six-way street market is a permanent market located in Sang-gu, Cheongju-si, which is the largest of the dozen Cheongju markets. In the past, the place was opened because of the name of the street, but now it is reduced to a range. Nevertheless, the front of the market gate with its huge tile roof is crowded like a street. Many people want to buy cheap goods. Don't panic if the front door is crowded. There are three public parking lots inside the market, so you only have to choose where to go.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The first thing you'll notice is the miniature trotters sold by the front door. Not long ago, it was introduced in TV shows and became popular. Unlike ordinary pork feet that have a lot of lumps, you can feel the chewing taste properly. A small alley behind the mini jogbal restaurant is the food alley at the meat street market. Tteok, Jeon, porridge, dumplings, and whole chicken are the main menus, and rumors of Sundae's popularity are overwhelming. Seemingly not so different from ordinary sundae, the taste becomes more curious.

   Suamgol, which is not far from the meat market, has the nickname 'Cheongju's last moon.' Several houses barely stood on the mountain slopes, and even the refugees settled here after the Korean War. The village, which was almost a gimmick, faced a completely different fate since 2008, when various murals were created as part of a public art project.

In 1976, after his wife and painter Park Rae-hyang passed away, Kim Ki-chang built his home in his mother's hometown and spent the rest of his life working there. Due to the rainy weather, the clouds and misty landscapes of the mountains were quite strangely matched with his hounbo.

It was huge but it was cozy because everything was in place. A lot of small courtyard roses bloomed in Sarangchae, and the bonsai and the chiefs who expressed his taste around the well-organized inner house revealed their presence here and there. The texture of the old hanok was elegant and elegant. Sitting on Daecheong floor and watching the rainy garden was so precious that I didn't want to change anything.
