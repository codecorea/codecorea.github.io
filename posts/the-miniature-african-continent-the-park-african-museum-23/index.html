   Where the sun is chosen, Africa

  <div class="txt_p">
   Africa, which means “the sun shines well” in Latin, is literally a continent full of passion under the abundant sun. Africa is home to a brilliant civilization. You can see the people living there breathing with nature at The Park African Museum (African Museum).
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The African Museum was first opened in 2006 to promote cultural exchanges with African countries. Take a slow stroll through the gardens and face the entrance to the museum, where you can experience African culture.

   Before entering the museum, if you are interested in sculptures, look closely at the shows and sculptures surrounding the garden. Showa sculpture, the essence of African stone culture, is a modern sculpture that began to develop around Zimbabwe's sculptural community in the 1950s. It is a highly difficult piece made by hand, using only traditional tools such as chisels and hammers, while maintaining the original shape to instill a spirit into the stone. It is recognized as a work of art so long as there is a saying that 'if there are 10 leading sculptors leading the world, at least five will be Shona sculptures'.

   Let's relax at the performance hall in front of the museum. A local cultural troupe in Africa, a lively cultural heritage, will perform lively and rhythmic dances along with live music to match traditional percussion instruments such as djembe. African dance is the basis of exciting dances such as mambo, twist, and disco that have been popular all over the world.

   If you're really excited, go upstage and shake it together. You can learn African dance properly. After the show, you will be given photo time, which is a good way to leave visible memories. However, because the performance is held twice a day, it is essential to check the time.
