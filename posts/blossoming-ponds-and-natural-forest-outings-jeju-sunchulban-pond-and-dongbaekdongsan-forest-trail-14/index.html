   Sunhul Village is located in the middle mountainous area of northeast Jeju. There is a small and small pond where only acquaintances visit. This is a village pond called Seonbanban Pond. If you don't pay attention to it, it's easy to pass by.

  <div class="txt_p">
   In late spring, when the early heat begins to come in, the Sunbahn Pond is filled with water lilies. It begins to bloom one by one in early May, and by mid-day, the pond is colored pink. Blooming petals among green round leaves remind us of pure and pure children.

   The water lily flower that rises above the dark blue water resembles the lotus that blooms in the mud. Resistant to the environment they are in, each one is like a beautiful flower, and the appearance is similar. If the water lily and lotus are a bit confusing, look closely at the leaf shape. Water lilies have flat leaves attached to the surface of water, and one side is deeply split, while lotus flowers have rounded leaves floating on the surface, as if an umbrella was opened. Dropping water on a lotus leaf rolls around without infiltrating or getting wet.

   On the other side of the line, there is a forest named Camellia Garden because many camellia trees grow. The forest was once the home of the people. Camellia oil was obtained from the forest and the trees were felled and charcoal burned. Through this, children were raised and villages were built. The forest that gave generously what he had. The Camellia Garden, which was a living place for the residents, was designated as Ramsar Wetland in 2011 and is now being taken care of by people.

   Ramsar wetlands are the designation and protection of wetlands that are worth preserving globally through international agreements. In Jeju, four sites were registered as Ramsar Wetland, Sunli-dong Dongbaekdong, Aqua Youngorim, Water Park Orion, and Hill 1100. The village of Sunhull 1-ri, where Dongbaek Garden is located, has earned a meaningful title as 'The Ramsar Village' for the first time in the world in 2013, thanks to the efforts of residents to keep their forests together.

   Dongbaekdongsan Forest Trail is gentle and flat, making it easy for children to walk. You can start from the Dongbaekdongsan Visitor Information Center across the Seonchulban Pond and go out to the west exit where Sunchulbun Bridge is located or back to the Wetland Center. The entire trail is about 5km long, and you can take a short walk in 2-3 hours.

   The Dongbaek Garden is also a historic place that embraces the pain of the residents. The dotle cave, which was found not long after, was a hideout for the residents who fled the tombs at the time of the 4.3 incident. Although you can't go inside the cave now, you can guess the desperate situation by looking at the entrance over the wire mesh. How many days have you been hiding in a narrow cave? It is a heavy step to turn to the sad heart.

   As we crawled through the thick roots of trees that crawled over the ground and wandered through the natural forest where trees and vines intertwined, we quickly reached the wetland. This is where Ramsar Marsh is designated. Distant water moss, which has been accumulated for a long time in the pit rock lava rock, is a rare wetland that is hard to find in Jeju. The sound of birds coming in from time to time in silence and silence is like a gift from nature. I go on my way back with a calm mind.
