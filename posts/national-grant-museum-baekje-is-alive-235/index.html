   The Baekje Culture Zone in Chungnam was caught up late due to the development of the Silla Culture Zone. Just 50 years ago, artifacts and information related to Baekje were significantly lower in quantity and level than they are now. It would not be an exaggeration to say that you were trapped in a labyrinth.

   The peculiar appearance is the best among the artifacts with its unusual appearance. The convex shape is armed with a shallow curve, and the symmetry is distinct from top to bottom, left and right, and the elaborate pattern is free from disturbance. Besides, it is neat until the deadline. This motive is said to be a relic supporting the fact that Buyeo was related to shamanism around Siberia.

   Baekje's Sabindo Island and Destruction
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Exhibition Hall 2 is full of stories of Baekje and Sabiseong. First, let's briefly talk about 'Sabi (Buyeo) Cheondo'. King Dongseong of Baekje, who was living in Woongjin (Princess), was looking for a place to build a better capital. The first place he wanted was the Han River basin. However, it was not as easy as it was to regain the lost Han River to a stable land. In the Three Kingdoms, the king of the same city directed the king to build a castle by sending entourage to Xabi, and it is said that he often hunted in Xabi. This is where the possibility that the king of Dongseong might have noticed Xabi was raised. After reaching King Muryeong and King Seongwang, he planned to relocate the city based on the strengthened kingship and to prepare the foundation for re-leaping to Sabi. In the 16th year of King Seongwang, Cheondo was promoted and the national name was changed to 'Nambuyeo'.

    Unlike the provinces, Buyeo has been developed with a special system called '5 parts, 5 clauses'. The capital was divided into 5 parts (upper part, front part, middle part, lower part, and rear part), and each section had 5 sections to strengthen the kingship through careful management. One of the five parts, the stone engraved with 'All', is the remains of the entrance to the second exhibition hall.

   Many records of Baekje are transmitted through stones or trees. In 1300, even hard stones became dull, making it difficult for the engraved letters to become difficult to recognize. Nevertheless, there is a record on the wood that is vulnerable to corrosion, so it is said to be 'wooden'.

   National Treasure No. 287 Baekje Geumdong Daehyangro
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    In October 1993, South Korea's attention was drawn to the bottom of the paddy field. It was the moment when the Baekje Geumdonghyangro was seen in the soil by the excavation team of the National Buyeo Museum. Experts did not hide the surprise by saying that the excavation was a "miracle." This preciousness crossed the gap of 1300 and provided the opportunity for the pale pulse of Baekje to re-pulse.
   </p>
   <p>
    The National Treasure No. 287, Baekje Geumdonghyanghyang, literally burns incense. It is believed to have been used for rituals related to Buddhism, a national religion at the time, and is a 6th-century work made of bronze as a main material. It consists of a lid, a body, and a base. It is 61.8 in height and 11.85 kg in weight, which is a relatively large part of the censer.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    I looked at the censer from top to bottom. At the top of the lid, the phoenix with its wings spread out stands with Yeouiju in its mouth, and below it, there are five mountain peaks and a musical instrument with different freshness between them. It is said that this is a reproduction of an ancient story related to Phoenix. Underneath, there are 27 animals of water, land, and sky, such as fish, deer, and cranes. Below the body is a dragon-shaped base. It is said that the appearance of this dragon is a representative form that was expressed in the ancient times of Korea. I remember seeing a similar dynamic and mysterious atmosphere somewhere, and it feels like a dragon in the Goguryeo tomb murals.
   </p>
   <p>
    The inner world contained in it as much as the exterior of the incense burner is also full of emotion. It can be seen that the phoenix is a representative of Yin and Yong-Yang and contains the Yin-Yang Pavilion. It is also said that the number 5, which overlaps 5 fresh and 5 mountain peaks, originated from the Five Elements. In addition, as can be seen from the 5th and 5th Control of Baekje, there seems to be a close relationship between Baekje and 5.

On the contrary, the more vivid the expression, the more delicate the pattern, the more precious it is and the more sophisticated the aesthetic sense of ancestors looks.
