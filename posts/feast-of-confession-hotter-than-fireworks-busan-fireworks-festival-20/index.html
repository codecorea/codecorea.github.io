   Confession of love delivered by fireworks
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    In October, the Busan Fireworks Festival is held every year. This year, two days from October 23, the theme of `` The beginning of love is confession '' was unchanged, and the city of Busan Gwangalli was brilliantly embroidered. However, we have prepared a much richer composition and various programs than before, and above all, we changed the way of directing the fireworks and greatly expanded the space of the fireworks show.
   </p>
   <p>
    The fireworks show, the center of the festival, has become more colorful and has made the hearts of the viewers more chewy. First of all, he invited the world's best overseas flame team to be enthralled. In addition, the way the fireworks were produced has not changed much over the past 10 years. Unlike the previous one, which was held for 50 minutes under one theme, it took a 5-minute break after the 15-minute invitational fireworks show, and increased the concentration by directing it to the melody that suits the theme 'The beginning of love is confession' for 35 minutes.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   During the five-minute break, special events caught the attention of the people. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the normalization of Korean-Japanese relations, a fire broke out on the Tsushima Island closest to us beyond the Korea Strait.

   The stage, which is bigger than ever, was also noticed. This year, Busan Fireworks Festival is the largest in history. Considering that visitors were unable to watch properly due to the concentration of visitors, the stage of the '-' shape, which was spread around Gwangan Bridge, was expanded to the shape of a 'U' band after Dongbaek Island, Gwangalli and Igidae. As a result, the stage production was also changed, so the fireworks were much richer than before.

   The Busan Fireworks Festival was only one day on the 24th, but on the 23rd, the day before, it was no less enjoyable. The biggest change is the eve concert. Last year's eve concert was held at Gwangalli Beach at 7:00 pm on the 23rd, which had nothing to do with the fireworks festival. Kim Beom-soo, Kim Tae-woo, Park Ji-min, Bernard Park, Son Seung-yeon, Jeong Dong-ha, Ali, and other singers gave me a more powerful stage than the fireworks. After the last night's concert, a 15-minute “overnight fireworks show” was held to inspire the festival.

   The fireworks festival is over, but there are ways to enjoy the afterglow. The winning work of the Busan Fireworks Festival, which was held to become a festival with citizens, is on display at the Suyeong Riverside Special Exhibition Hall on the 31st under the theme of "Harmony of Light and Softening."
