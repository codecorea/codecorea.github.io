   In Sinsido, people began to live in the early days of Silla due to the herring of herring around the island. Gogunsan-gun, with its beautiful scenery called “star in the lake,” is the largest of the 24 islands. I would like to stop for a while and leave a picture if I am running along a cool road along the embankment. That's why it's nice to see a rest area or an observatory. One of the most famous is the Saemangeum Rest Area, which is located at the highest 199 peak (199 m above sea level) in Sinsi-do. Opposite is a monument to the construction of the Saemangeum Seawall.

   It is not so difficult to see the landscape of Gogunsan-gun at the rest area. Behind the parking lot of the rest area, there is a way up to Wolyeongjae which is a 7 course of Gunsan winding road. It is an alley connecting Sinsi-do and the embankment, and it can be said to be the starting point for the realization of Gogunsan-gun. As you climb the slope, you will find a crossroad between 199 and Wolyeongbong. Wolyeongbong is composed of columnar joints that can be enjoyed in Jeju Island.

   When it is said to go in and experience, the people who change their boots to go to the mud flats quickly and easily. This is because it is a perfect moment for you to feel the taste of fish thicker than your forearm. It is the site of the “opening experience”, which is the No. 1 public trust that made the new city a “nole island”.

   Opening is the traditional fishing way to catch fish. At low tide, the pine pilings are semi-oval on the mud flats, and the bottom of the net is buried along the pilings on the bottom of the mud flats. At high tide, we sailed out of the boat, hung the top of the net on the pine stakes, and spread the net.

   The expectation that fishing is difficult due to the muddy water is missed nicely. If the water depth gets shallower, the mullet, which is over 50cm long, will appear, but it is more appropriate to say that it is difficult to catch it with great force. Feel for the first time in life

   Experience is not possible every day, so make a reservation after checking the date by phone or through the website. It's a fishing method using tea, so you can experience it around the corner. Also, don't be late for experience. You should start on time to enjoy longer.

   The Sinsido Fishing Village offers free boot rental for an easy opening experience. However, the fish scales are slippery, so preparing a paddock is essential. It's a good idea to get extra clothes because you may get wet in the sea or you might fall off a mud flat.
