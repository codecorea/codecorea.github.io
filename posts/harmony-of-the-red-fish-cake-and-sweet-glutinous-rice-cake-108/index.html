   The recipes and appearances do not vary greatly from shop to shop. There are only slightly different sauce tips for each shop. Some are spicy and some are less spicy. You can choose according to your taste. Generally, they are served with tempura and gimbap, and some places offer other foods. Red fish paste is strangely addictive. If you eat one, you will eat two or three. The price is good so you can eat more than one. It is 1,000 won for 4 red fish cakes.

   Take a bite, Dengsil Dunk ~, 'Dunksil' glutinous rice cake and donuts
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   A must-try snack in Jecheon with red fish paste is glutinous rice cake of 'dunkilssik'. I'm so excited about the name of the store. The name "Dengshil" means "to everyone in the world," and "to taste deliciously." In front of the shop, there is a small signboard with a friendly greeting. The signs that change every day bring little fun. The rustic store facade reflects decades of history. Following his mother-in-law, daughter-in-law has been handed down for the second generation. So many old regular customers. If you want to taste glutinous rice cakes and donuts on the weekend, hurry up a little. It's because it's so popular that it's too early to be a full version. Remember that Sunday is closed.

   Dengsil Bun makes both glutinous rice cakes and donuts by hand. It's fun to see how red bean paste is put into chewy glutinous rice dough to make crunchy rice cake. Seeing glutinous rice cakes filled on a large tray makes mouthwatering. Even in chilly weather, a fan runs to cool the glutinous rice cake on one side. When the hot seaweed of glutinous rice cake falls out, put it in a box.

   One large glutinous rice cake is just 700 won. Glutinous rice cake made with domestic glutinous rice and domestic red beans is very affordable. Try a bite of glutinous rice cake. Rather than a board draws, chewy chewy lives. Red bean is filled in immaculate glutinous rice cake. Bean jam is not sweet. The color and taste are very different from those of ordinary glutinous rice cake. This is because not only red-red beans in dunsil's meal, but also dark green gray beans are used to make red bean paste. Boil red beans usually twice a day.

In Dungsil, ferment the dough with rice wine and rice water instead of yeast. Donuts are sold hot as soon as they are fried. There are two kinds of donuts. Dongle adzuki bean donuts with red beans inside, and dungling donuts without beef. On weekends, you can only taste Dungling Donuts. In response to a customer question, "What's in this?" Dangling donuts are chewy and sweet even if nothing is in them.
