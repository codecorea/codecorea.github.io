    Eunjagol Takju, located in Sangju, Gyeongbuk, is a Takju with a tradition of over 100 years in the 3rd generation. When the excellent water taste became known by chance, it was reborn as Eunjagol Takbae. Let's meet the story of the people who make the 100-year-old Eunjagokpagi and Takju.

   Sangju's traditional rice wine with a long history
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    Eunjagol, which is named after the hermit with the courage to save the dead, has a ‘Sake Ripening Village’ that brews Takju with the lives and loves of ordinary people. Eunjagol Takgi is right there.
    <br/>
    Takbaegi is a dialect of Takju's Gyeongsang-do and has been established as a liquor representing the common people and is called a home or farm. Eunjagol Takbaegi, which has a tradition of over 100 years, contains the love of the people who make Takju. Eunjagol Takbae has been passed down for the third time since Lee Dong-young, who died in 1994, and is the daughter-in-law and current president Lim Ju-won and her son Lee Jae-hee.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   The history of Eunjagol Takbae goes back to the 1940s. Lim Dong-young, the father-in-law of Im Joo-won, said that he was very attached to rice wine. In contrast to the taste of makgeolli of the brewery operated by Mae-hyung at that time, he started to brew brewery from high school and started to make makgeolli from the age of 21. Eventually, the beginning of Euncheok Brewery was when the older brother took over the entire brewery, which had been in operation for decades, and started making alcohol in earnest.

   The taste of makgeolli is so good that there are many episodes. When neighbors were drinking alcohol in front of the brewery, when they were drunk, they brought a rear car and carried it. During the Korean War, the People's Army came into contact, but the People's Army, who had tasted rice wine, quickly broke the brewery of the brewery and insisted on making more alcohol. Go Dong-young's love for rice wine was also great. Makgeolli for him was rice and medicine. Makgeolli is said to be good for the body and always drank one or two glasses on an empty stomach. His grandson, Jae-hee Lee, also remembers eating a cup on an empty stomach.

   The taste of Eunjagol Takgi that changed the fate of the brewery
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   <p>
    In the 1980s, operation of the brewery began to become difficult. As the sales volume of soju and beer increased, the number of people visiting Makgeolli gradually decreased. After her father-in-law died in 1994, the brewery was taken over by daughter-in-law Im Ju-won. It was thanks to an accidental meeting with a professor of microbiology at Kyungpook National University that Euncheok Brewery was born again. At one point, a professor of microbiology came to Euncheok-myeon to tour the mushroom farm, and accidentally came to Mr. Lim's house. It was hot on the day, so I recommended a glass of water, but the professor who drunk the water praised the taste of water, saying, "It is the most suitable water for making makgeolli." Next, Makgeolli told us about alcohol, not just alcohol, but our traditional fermented food. At the time, I could have served drinks or fruit, but wasn't it probably a fateful choice for silverware dumplings when I first thought about making cool water? From this point on, Im Joo-won said that he had seen Makgeolli again, and decided to raise and rebuild Euncheok Brewery.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Before starting the brewery in earnest, he began to study yeast and rice wine. The biggest drawback of makgeolli is that the back end is not good, and when you trim it, the smell of odor comes up. As a result, after spending about two years as you drowned in drinking alcohol, silver porcelain dumpling was born. In the old-fashioned way, it was not only toxic in the fermentation process, but also because it drank makgeolli in a state that it was not ripened, it was mainly fermented in the stomach, causing belching and pain in the head. Eunjagoltakbaegi, which has increased aging period at low temperature, has a unique taste. A few years ago, she met her first face at a restaurant in Mungyeong. Takju's unique, thick and thick taste was low, and the tingling sensation, like a soft drink, was very refined and new. I remember asking the restaurant owner where to get makgeolli because I didn't have any tea to drink makgeolli while drinking or after drinking it.

   Euncheok Brewery has arrived at the present after undergoing extensive renovation work after the CEO Lim Ju-won inherited it from his father-in-law. However, the entrance room, which is the fermentation room used by the father-in-law, is a green door that looks shabby and strong. It is the only old figure in Eunjagol Takbaegi. Euncheok Brewery has only three fermentation rooms, the main and traditional fermentation rooms and modern fermentation rooms where yeast is grown using yeast, and is divided into a space where steamed godubap is dried and an automated space that incorporates low-temperature aged rice wine.

   Namjangsa Temple, a millennium review that represents Sangju
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Namjangsa is the largest temple in the Sangju region, and is a millennium temple founded by Jingamguksa in the Unified Silla period. Jingamguksa Temple is the protagonist of Hadong Ssanggyesa Jingamseonsatopabi, one of Choi Chi-won's inscriptions. Namjangsa is the temple that he built from China and planted and planted around Ssanggyesa Temple. Namjangsa is located in the middle of Noeumsan Mountain, so the gloomy forest road is great.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   On the way to Namjangsa, I first meet Seokjangseung with a unique face. It features large, dark-looking eyes, baburico that doesn't fit with the eyes, and canines that point out under the lips. It is a stubby face on the whole, but it is Seok Jang Seung with a sharp and curiously cute corner.
   <br/>
   When the horror passes through a gorgeous circumference, the carvings of male characters are gathered on the stone piles piled after shaving the mountainside.

    Namjangsa has a long history, but it is well known as the epicenter of the legend of the legendary woodcarving tank and the origin of the crew. Woodcarving is a tangerine carved in wood, unlike the tangerine painting on paper or silk. The woodcarving tanks, which are called by the Akagata Amitaro Method, are enshrined in Bogwangjeon and Gwaneumwon, each of which is designated as a treasure. In front of Bogwangjeon's woodcarving tank, there is also the iron sculptural monument designated as treasure No. 990, so don't forget to look around with the colorful pieces of woodcarving tank.
