   Separate rice, side dish, light and firm Chungmu Gimbap
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Chungmu Gimbap, one of Tongyeong's representative delicacies, became known to the public in the early 1980s when Tongyeong was still 'Chungmu'. Usually gimbap is spread out after adding rice to the side dish and eat it. Chungmu gimbap is served as rice and side dish as a side dish.

   Unlike regular gimbap, which contains various ingredients such as ham, eggs, tuna, and cheese, the side dish is simple with stir-fried radish kimchi, squid and fish paste. If you roll white rice at a good size and add side dishes and soup, it is not enough for a meal.

   There are some 'theories' in the birth of Chungmu Gimbap. One is that my wife, who had packed Kimbab with her husband's lunch box, began to eat rice and side dishes when Kimbab was constantly hurting. The other is that Chungmu Gimbap, which has separate rice and side dishes, was created to make gimbap that does not hurt many people around Tongyeong Passenger Terminal. Gimbap evolved to be less affected by the warm southern weather.

   However, the first Chungmu Gimbap was a little different from what it is now. Jukumina cuttlefish, mussels and radish kimchi were put on bamboo skewers and wrapped in gimbap and paper. Many people were looking for a delicious and easy to eat. The rice is the same, but the current side dish of Chungmu Gimbap can be eaten with skewers. The ingredients were replaced by squid and fish paste, which are easily available instead of Juku or cuttlefish.

   Awesome broth for lovers, Zolbok and Sirak soup

  <div class="txt_p">
   If you are a liquor or gourmet, you might have heard of it in the wind. Haejangguk, the first place of Tongyeong's main parties, is the solbok country. It literally cleans up the scallop guts, 'little blowfish', and adds buttercups, bean sprouts, and radish to boil cleanly. It is famous for its cool broth, which blows away any excessive drinking. The cold breeze is in season, but thanks to the improved technology, it can be tasted as a Tongyeong special. Don't forget to add a drop of vinegar when you eat Zhubok Guk. Presses the blowfish's toxicity.

   A little unfamiliar name, 'teotgegi' refers to thin slices of raw or boiled sweet potatoes and dried in the sun. When sweet potatoes are dried, the moisture evaporates and the sweet potatoes are twisted. This is called `` pecking '' in Gyeongsang-do. When rice was precious, he ate hunger by eating porridge with dried sweet potatoes. It is 'tteokgi porridge'. Born to be a 21st-century “well-being snack” overflowing with food, it is loved as a sweet snack for those who found Tongyeong. In the vicinity of Gangguan, you can taste it at Honey Complex (055-649-0032) and Tongyeong Uji and Porridge (055-645-7909). Vacuum-packed porridge can be heated at home.
