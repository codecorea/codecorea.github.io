   Sometimes I travel for my own time. Journey for me. But not once or twice have been beaten by people. Here is an island in the South Sea where you can confuse these memories. Yeosu Red Rim. There are no gourmet restaurants or tourist attractions. There is a landing bridge that can be used to cross the road at Kep, but the time in Red Geumdo is still slow.
  </div>

   Island where walk is obligatory, red gold road
  </strong>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Jeokgeumdo is located at the entrance of the women's bay which Yeosu-si and Goheung-gun bear. Although it belongs to Yeosu-si in administrative area, it is closer to Goheung-gun by location. At the end of 2016, the completion of the Palyoung Bridge, which connected Goheung-gun and Jeokum-do, made the two locations more convenient.
   <br/>
   The name of Geumdo Island in the early Joseon period was Red Lake. It has another name. It is also called 'Jakmimi Island' because there are many pebbles in the seaside. 'Gimmy' means the corner of the sea. In fact, the shoreline was filled with black pebbles that were rounded and polished by seawater. By the time of the Japanese colonial rumors that there was a gold mine in Red Geumdo, people who tried to dig gold came in, but all failed and left. The name Geumgeumdo (積 金 島) is made by combining the theory that there is gold in the pronunciation of small island.
  </div>
  <div class="txt_p">
   Currently, the construction of a landing bridge that connects Goheung-gun from Yeosu-si to Jobal-do, Nando, Dun-byeong-do and Jeokgeum-do is in progress. For this reason, the construction site is found when you cross Palyoung Bridge and arrive at the island. There is also a sign that it is difficult to enter a car. Stop at the entrance to the island and start walking. This is because you have to walk slowly and look around in order to feel red geumdo. The entire coastline is about 9 km long, so it's not too much to trek. Two to three hours is enough to go around the center of town.

   At present, there is a lack of amenities for travelers. As soon as you cross Palyoung Bridge, there is a rest stop at the Geumri-ri Station. You'd better have your meals prepared here or buy what you need. It is also good to take pictures with Palyoung Bridge in the parking lot of the Rip Geumni Rest Area. There is also a shop in the building behind the warehouse.

   Red Geumdo Island is long to the north and south and bent to the east. Houses are gathered along the eastern shore of the hills in the center of the island. The start of the walk along the Geumdo Island begins from the back of the Geumgeum Crossing Palyoung Bridge to the west of the island. Stairs are visible into the forest on the left before entering the village through the construction of the bridge. There is a hyoyeol door at the end of the stairs.

   Walk a little further along the back of the road and go up to the alley along the bank of the Red Gold Agricultural Cooperatives. In order to go to the red gold branch school Since it was closed a long time ago, children cannot play but it is a good place to spend time thinking about childhood. It's a closed school, but it's not old-fashioned. The sky-painted roof and the lush trees are nice.

   Continue walking up the way to the main gate of Jeokgeum branch. The Red Geum Church, Red Geum-ri Office, and the Security Center are next. Jepumum is also the center of the city. The appearance of Red Geum Church painted white outside goes well with the atmosphere of the island. In the courtyard of the Red Interest Rate Office, there is a zelkova tree that is over 400 years old. It is a protective water with a perimeter of only 370cm and a height of 25m. From the highest position of the village, it stands overlooking Red Rim and the sea.

   Now it's time to go down to town. It doesn't matter which alley you go to. Just follow the inclined path towards the sea. You exit the alley at a slow pace and you're in front of the dock that tied up the boats. An all-time truck that has just visited Red Geumdo is in operation with attracting new residents. It's nice to see all the trucks I've met in a while. It is a mobile home shopping that is still active in the age of advanced technology.
