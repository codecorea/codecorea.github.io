   Autumn on the west coast is abundant. From lobsters to fat seas to right-sized tuna and crabs. If the sky rises with the shaking sea, if it becomes lonely or weak, why don't you go with the best friend of the world and yourself?

    Taean travel can be largely divided into Taean and Southern Anmyeon and Anmyeondo. The face bridge bridges the two. In terms of administrative area, it belongs to the same 'Tae', but the distance between the island and the peninsula is quite legal. For example, Anmyeondo Flower Garden Coast and North Taean Sinduri Coastal Sand Dunes are about 70 minutes by self-drive. That's why you have to move around thinking about copper lines. If you have time, you may want to add Seosan, Hongseong, and Boryeong, which is the path to Taean and faces Cheonsu Bay. Hongseong and Boryeong, located near Cheonsu Bay, easily reach across the Seosan embankment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Besides, it is autumn. This season is full of West Coast food festivals. Daeha is in full swing at Baeksajang Port in Anmyeon-do (Baeksa Pogu Daeha Festival · 10.8 ~ 10.30) and Hongseong Namdang Port (Hongseong Namdang Port Daeha Festival · 9.9 ~ 10.30) facing Cheonsu Bay. West Coast autumn specialties musketeers and crab also gained weight. If you go up the road after the wind, it is heaven.

   The reporter visited Gwanwoldo and decided to see the fall from the flower garden. Starting with Gwanwoldo, we decided to head over the white sand to the flower garden. We decided to visit the white sand beach Pogu which is famous for the wild lobster festival. Both the heat and the heat are fading, and the vacancy of the season, when the autumn begins in earnest, soothes the beaches along the coast of Anmyeondo and wherever small muzzles touch.

   The high tide of September 22, 2016, at Gwanwol-do, is 2:00 pm. Ganwoldo is Ganwolam, and Ganwolam is Ganwoldo. The deep flesh of the West Sea, far from the sea, is rough and gentle. It is located close to the land, so you can enter without limitation. The Goryeo Horse Academic Ambassador was named Ganwolam because he was enlightened at the moon during the capital. When the water is full, it resembles a lotus floating on the sea, and it is also called 'Yonhwadae'. The west sea, which was considered muddy, is green. It looks like the green sea I saw somewhere.

   There are many oyster dishes near Ganwol-do. You can taste nutritious oyster rice from &lt;Mtd Garden&gt; and &lt;Ganwolpogu Nutrition Oyster Rice&gt;. Get out of Ganwol-do and enter Anmyeon-do. Anmyeondo was originally a land, not an island. Most of the ships loaded with three songs from Samnam in the Joseon Dynasty headed for Hanyang through the West Sea, passing Boryeong offshore, Taean Anheungyang and Dangjin. Among them, Anheung was off the coast of the Taean Peninsula with a large tide and a high speed and a lot of reefs.

   This was a loss of state finances. The alternative found in the mediation at that time was fortune. In 1638, an ant wood was dug out of a canal between Sinon-ri, Nam-myeon and Angi-eup Changgi-ri, north of Anmyeon-do. Anmyeondo became an island like this.

   Anmyeondo, which is famous for producing Daeha, is a place where you can see and taste wild lobsters. How can I clearly distinguish wild manure from aquaculture? First of all, the beard is long and the color is clear. There is a big difference in size and color. The wild crayfish, frozen last spring, are much larger than this fall. The nature is so urgent that it is hard to see alive, but you can also taste the fresh treats that you just caught.

   Most of the alive swimmers we've known as treats are white-legged shrimp. On September 22, 2016, at the White Cove Port Suhyup, Sunghan's wild lobster was traded for about 35,000 won per kg, and around 25,000 won for wounds caught in the net. The price fluctuates depending on the amount of catchers.
