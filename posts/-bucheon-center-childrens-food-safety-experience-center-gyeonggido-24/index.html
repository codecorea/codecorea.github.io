   Open the door and you'll notice a photo zone with a large sandwich bed and cracker table. As you pass the photo zone, a trimman with a long nose, like Pinocchio, looks down at the visitor. It looks like you're sucking on a soda can with a straw, and you can press a button in the middle of the can to trim it. While eating, the air swallowed together flows back into the esophagus. The soda contains a large amount of carbon dioxide, which results in undigested gas. It's easy to feel good at digestion, but it doesn't really help.

   Behind the trimman, there are several farting chairs that sound ‘Pooh’. Even though it makes a sound without smell, the children hold the nose and sit down and stand and have fun. If you endure farts, they may be absorbed into the blood or pee. However, if you put up with it too long, your stomach will get sore and your stomach will not be able to digest.

   After watching the video, the experiment of making strawberry milk begins. There are white milk and coloring on the table where children sit together. Add a few drops of pink to white milk, a few drops of strawberry-flavored additives, and sugar to mix the sweet strawberry milk that kids love. Strawberry milk or banana milk does not contain strawberries or bananas, but rather is an experiment that tells you that a lot of food additives and sugar. Almost all processed foods contain various food additives such as pigments, preservatives and coagulants. Food additives can cause allergies, diarrhea and vomiting and increase the risk of scary diseases such as anemia, cancer and hepatitis. Avoid processed foods that contain food additives, such as white milk rather than strawberry or banana milk, and fish rather than crab meat.

   The children are busy laughing when they enter the corner of our digestion story. This is because the whole body comes out on the screen and the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anal images are shown in the body, showing how the food is digested and taken into the poop. It's fun to squat and take a poop. Next to it is the 'Mysterious Table' where you learn balanced eating habits. Among the foods that appear on the screen, you can select the foods that fit your mission and put them on the plate.

   Smart Mart and Bad Mart show children's favorite high-calorie, low-nutrition and junk food. First, the smart mart picks one of the baskets on the display and puts it on a plate.
