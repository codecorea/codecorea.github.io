            In fact, 'taste' has nothing to do with the season. Didn't find hot food in the summer because of the heat. The same is true for winter. The cold noodles called 'cool noodles' were a winter delicacy in the north of Korea. Nevertheless, there is a ‘taste’ that crosses the season. The hot taste of the tip of the nose, the whole body getting hot, and the drops of sweat springing up one by one. Here's a spicy taste that will blow you away from the stress that comes up behind your neck even when you're in tears. Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour
