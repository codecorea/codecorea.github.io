            Sneakers made by collecting PET bottles discarded in the sea, tarpaulins for old trucks, airbags for scrapped cars, bags made of seat belts, and watches made from scrapped bicycle chains are sold at a higher price than ordinary products. Some are not available because they are limited edition. Literally, the junk is transformed into a masterpiece. In the world, 'UpCycling' is the trend. In Europe, upcycling crazes have been blowing in Korea since several years ago. Upcycling is derived from recycling, which means recycling, and refers to adding new values such as design beyond simply reusing discarded objects. Where is the fashion field? Upcycling spaces are emerging in Korea these days. Many places called hot places across the country are attracting attention by upcycling abandoned spaces. We can't introduce all the famous spots across the country, so let's start with Gangneung, the representative summer vacation destination.

            I missed the peak of spring flowers, is it just swallowing the sadness? Jinan Mai Mountain is located on a plateau, where cherry blossoms bloom until late. It is a bulwark of cherry blossom viewing. The shading of Maisan reflected in the Top Youngje Reservoir and the rare stone tower of Topsa serve as a “travel insurance” even after flowering. If you take a walk at Jinan Red Ginseng Spa or Baekwoon Village Village, it is a springtime destination regardless of flowers. Jinan-gun, Jeollabuk-do, Korea. Korea Tour

            There are many ways to enjoy a 500-year history tour of Joseon in Seoul. Perhaps one of the first hands is the palace where the king of Joseon Dynasty stayed. The four main palaces in the Joseon Dynasty that remain in Seoul are Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace, and Deoksugung Palace. They open the night landscape under the name of night viewing. Jongno, Daehak-ro, and Gwanghwamun walk through the downtown of Seoul, and the night view of the palace that passed by is very popular. That's because it closes as soon as you start buying tickets every night. If you missed this special tour, take a look at the day and night scenery of the palace and try your next special tour. Clearly, it is our proud history that is unfortunate and unfortunate to see only at night. Jongno-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour
