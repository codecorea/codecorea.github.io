            Gangwon-do, where freshness goes and the clouds rest. At the end of last winter, too many snow clouds were resting. The ever-falling snow became a natural disaster, causing great damage to Gangwon-do. In 2005, a wildfire that came over in a strong wind hit Naksansa Temple. Ironically, it was Arbor Day on April 5. The forest fires caused Naksansa to be close to the battlefield. I couldn't help but be sorry for the sight of the burning of the cylinder and the melting of the same Joseon dynasty designated as a treasure. Naksansa Temple, which has risen again due to unfaithfulness, is still a sanctuary of seawater Kannon. Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do, Korea. Korea Tour

            From autumn 2013 to winter, the city of Masan got attention again. It is because of the drama <Response, 1994> that sparked a big topic. The family of Najung, the owner of the boarding house, and the garbage, the main character, were all from Masan. In the drama, Masan was often mentioned, and in the meeting scene that gave a big smile, 'Masan's 3rd Gapbu' sons also appeared. As such, in the background of 1994, Masan City existed proudly. At that time, no one would have thought that Masan City would disappear. Masan was a nationwide city in the 1970s and 1980s and the best city in Gyeongnam. However, in July 2010, it was integrated with Changhae City along with Jinhae City, and now exists as Masan Membership District and Masan Happo District within Changwon City.

The Daecheon Beach is the site of the Boryeong Mud Festival, and the Muchangpo Beach is famous for opening the sea of mystery. That's why summer vacationers visit a lot. If you are planning a summer resort on the beach of Boryeong, look back at Yongdu, Doksan, and Jangan.

            Seochon Village, the nickname for the western village of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Let's take a look at the map before starting a full-scale Seochon village tour. If you want to know where Seochon really refers to, I would recommend a map of the Seoul Castle that was introduced around Inwangsan (338m), Bukaksan (342m), Naksan (125m), and Namsan (262m). Now, the meaning has faded, but the boundary that separates 'inside and out of the city of Hanyang' is this Seoul Castle. Just as modern people in the 21st century want to live in Gangnam, at that time their ancestors probably didn't want to live in the 'Sadaeseongmun'. Jongno-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour
