Indeed, it is a section of the old Gyeongchun Line that leads to Daeseong-ri, Cheongpyeong, Gapyeong, Gangchon, and Chuncheon, so it is loved only by hearing its name. It is a place where every middle-aged person in Korea would have buried at the edge of the old days. Let's go on a memory trip to Gangchon Station, which was once a pronoun of youth and romance.

            In 1926, during the Japanese colonial rule, Jinhae Station (Registered Cultural Festival No. 192) was established. After the Japanese imperialism, which discovered the geographical importance of Jinhae Bay early on, developed Jinhae as a military port city, it was intended to connect the railway between Jinhae Port and the inland. Jinhae Station had a painful time handling Japanese and military supplies. After the independence, it was used as a major route for the logistics required for passengers as well as national defense. Passenger handling was suspended due to lack of demand in 2015, but the history of local history during the Japanese occupation period remains intact and is being managed as a modern cultural heritage. The journey of Jinhae's modern cultural heritage starts at Jinhae Station and tours around Jungwon Rotary, about 500 meters south. Changwon, Gyeongnam, South Korea. Korea Tour
