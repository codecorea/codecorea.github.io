            I have a carpenter friend. When asked about the merits of work, the answer is, "I can touch the tree." I also like to touch trees. The texture of the wood is 'emotional' compared to other objects. Not smooth but calm While living in wood, even after dying in furniture and books. So when you touch a tree, 'good' and 'reliable' are pushed to one side of your heart.
