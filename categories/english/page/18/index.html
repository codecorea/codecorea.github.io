            The Suncheon Bay International Garden Expo will be held until October 20th in Suncheon, a beautiful and prosperous island. As its name suggests, it is an eco-friendly ecological exhibition that presents gardens and cultures from around the world in Suncheon Bay. To be easy to solve'Feast of Flowers Blooming on the Suncheon Bay Stage'Maybe not. I am curious in this passage. Why Suncheon Bay? First, let's start with the location of Suncheon Bay. Boseong Beolgyo in the west and Gwangyang in the east, and Suncheon, located between them, directly touch the South Sea. Thanks to the Goheung Peninsula below Boseong and the Yeosu Peninsula below Gwangyang, Suncheon has “Suncheon Bay” on both sides. Suncheon, which has both Goheung and Gobaekho Gwangyang on the left, gained only the Namhae and Suncheon bays that are stable to look at. At the end of Namdo Island, Suncheon also has fresh water stems that touch the sea. The streams of the valley gathered to form a river, and the rivers continued to go out to sea. In the space where fresh water meets salty water, where the two are mixed, more diverse stories are born. Only Suncheon belongs here. Suncheon, Jeonnam, Korea. Korea Tour

            Is there another city that goes well with Chuncheon to add the modifier of romance? Chuncheon, like the word “spring”, is a fluttering excitement that makes you unheard of. The attractions that have been loved for a long time, such as the Soyang River Dam, Uiam Lake, Cheongpyeongsa Temple, and Gongjicheon Stream, may have helped make Chuncheon a romantic city, but in fact, the calm elements hidden in various parts of Chuncheon may make Chuncheon a more romantic space.

Let's take a look at the three-month forecast from the Korea Meteorological Administration from June to August 2013. “The summer temperature will be higher than the average, and the precipitation will be similar to the average. 9 to 11 typhoons will occur, and 1 to 2 will affect Korea. ” If you look at this in detail by month, “There will be many cloudy days under the influence of low pressure in July and many hot days under August under the influence of high pressure in the North Pacific.” Families interested in weather forecasting and meteorological phenomena should visit the Korea Meteorological Administration and enjoy experiential learning. Like a weather forecaster, you can draw a weather map based on the air pressure layout and stand in front of a TV camera to become a weather caster that delivers weather news.
