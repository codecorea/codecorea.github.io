            I missed the peak of spring flowers, is it just swallowing the sadness? Jinan Mai Mountain is located on a plateau, where cherry blossoms bloom until late. It is a bulwark of cherry blossom viewing. The shading of Maisan reflected in the Top Youngje Reservoir and the rare stone tower of Topsa serve as a “travel insurance” even after flowering. If you take a walk at Jinan Red Ginseng Spa or Baekwoon Village Village, it is a springtime destination regardless of flowers. Jinan-gun, Jeollabuk-do, Korea. Korea Tour

            There are many ways to enjoy a 500-year history tour of Joseon in Seoul. Perhaps one of the first hands is the palace where the king of Joseon Dynasty stayed. The four main palaces in the Joseon Dynasty that remain in Seoul are Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace, and Deoksugung Palace. They open the night landscape under the name of night viewing. Jongno, Daehak-ro, and Gwanghwamun walk through the downtown of Seoul, and the night view of the palace that passed by is very popular. That's because it closes as soon as you start buying tickets every night. If you missed this special tour, take a look at the day and night scenery of the palace and try your next special tour. Clearly, it is our proud history that is unfortunate and unfortunate to see only at night. Jongno-gu, Seoul, Korea. Korea Tour

Among them, we walk on the sunrise road of Donghae City, where the magnificent seascape and charming sights are combined. The coastal road (ilchulro) hidden inside National Highway 7 passes through Mukho Port, Eodal Port, and Daejin Port. Mukho Lighthouse, Nongoldamgil, Kamakbawi, and many other attractions, simple and small houses and shops are in harmony. When you pass by car, you can see the scenes that you may have missed.
