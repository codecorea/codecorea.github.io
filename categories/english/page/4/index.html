            The wildflower trail that represents the metropolitan area is Mt. Cheonma, Namyangju. At 812m above sea level, various flowers bloom along the season without any burden. The route from the entrance of Supyeongsa in Hopyeong-dong to Cheolma's house and the Dolphin Spring is a section that can be called 'wild road'. White camellia and noodle trees, which cover the trail, bloom until the end of June. A lovely foot-shaped tree with purple flowers under the heart-shaped leaves tells a sad story when a mother and daughter miss her. Cheonmasan is now waiting for you with wild flowers, namely grasshoppers, moths, hawksbill flowers, wild pheasant's legs, grass swabs, true flower, dragonfly, and fin thistle. Take a slow look at the grass.There is plenty to enjoy on National Highway 45, which runs alongside the Bukhangang River. Hongyuneung, where Gojong and obedience fell asleep, is also impressive.

            In fact, 'taste' has nothing to do with the season. Didn't find hot food in the summer because of the heat. The same is true for winter. The cold noodles called 'cool noodles' were a winter delicacy in the north of Korea. Nevertheless, there is a ‘taste’ that crosses the season. The hot taste of the tip of the nose, the whole body getting hot, and the drops of sweat springing up one by one.
