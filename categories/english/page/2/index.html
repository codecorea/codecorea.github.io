To send military beauty to the battlefield to fill their ambitions. The novelist Jo Jung-rae wrote in Arirang the history of suffering and resistance that the minchos had to face in this process.

            Journey through the alleys of the city centerSeocho-gu, Seoul, KoreaI think of traveling far away. However, it is urban travel that is becoming a new trend of travel for modern people who can hardly find a trip. Among them, a trip to an alleyway centered on a particular street brings new pleasures. Bangbae-dong in Seoul reminds us of a cafe alley, but there is a new way.
