            Sokcho is known as the red crab producing area called red snow crab. Among them, Dongmyeong Port boasts abundant quantities thanks to the red crab boat going in and out. Most people choose “Grab crab” as their delicacy on the east coast, and “Hong crab”, which is being pushed by snow crabs and treated as a two-factor, is also a delicacy.

The latter example is Hwacheon Mountain Trout Festival. At Hwacheon Mountain Trout Festival, ice fishing, ice sledding, ice football, ice bicycle, skating, and other winter games were gathered. All the fun in winter can be enjoyed. Even if it is not explained with the title of “World Four Winter Festival” and “7 Wonders of World Winter,” it has become a representative winter festival in Korea.
